i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my pisars handy whenever am writing anything but
i had already finished editing the pieace and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
disabled ajitive crippled helpless useless rect
stalled mamed wounded mangled lame mutilated
run down worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handy caped
se nile de crepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
see also hurt useless and weak antinems healthy strong capable
i was reading this liss out loud to a friend and atferst was laughing it was so ludicrous but ihad just gotten pasd mangled
when my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
ah an an impact that the assault from these words unleashed
noan i'm of course is is my raggedy old vesaris i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date rihte but in fact e printit was the early nineteen eaighties
when i would have been a starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids ind the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using it the sorrus back then
i mean from this entury it would seem that i was borne into a world that perceived some one like me to have nothing positive what soever going for them when in fact to day
i'm celebrated fir ah the opportunities and adventures my life have procured so am i immediately
went to look up the two thousand nine a on line adition expecting to find a rivision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
unfortunately it's not much better i find thee the last two words under near antinums particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
so it's not just about the words
it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks in the romans believed that to utter a curse
verbily was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's impowered
by casually doing something as symble as naming a person a child
we might be pudding lidbs and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
once at a person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the  a dipant institute in welmington delaware his name is doctor peetsa tillo
am no an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor pe and doctor p
always wore really colorful boties and am had the very perfect disposition to work with children
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical fere precessions
i had to do what seeme like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands a different colors you know
to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
you no i was already bargaining at a fidr old child with doctor pee to try to get out of doing hese exercises unsuccessfully of course
and one day he came in to my session am exhaustive and unforgiving
thes sessions and he said to me wa ame you are such a strong powerful little girl
i think yu'regon to break one of those bands when you do break it im moin to give you a hundred box now corse ti this was a simple ploy
on doctor pa's part to get me to do the exercise as i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest fidyear old in the second floor ward
but what he affectedly did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
and i have to wonder to day to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and atholetic person well into the future
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
but in the previous instances of those thesara centry yet our language isn't allowing us to envolve into the reality that we would all want
nor the possibility of an individual to see themselves is capable
our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which hae been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
my legs ah no lazor surgery for vision imperament a tytanium knees and hip replacemens for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature is imposed on them
not to mention social net working platforms allows people to selth identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go aline with global groups of their own choosing
thou perhaps hycknowledgy is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that every one has something rare and powerful to offer our society
and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest ascet a human ability to adapt is an interesting thing because people
have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
and i'm an ammake an admission this prays never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side step or circum navogate the presume pitballs of a life with proschetics or what other people perceive is my disability
but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge wether physically emotionally or both and ominous suggest that this is a good thing
adversity isn't an obstacle that we need toget around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
and i ten to think of it like my shadow sometimes i feel lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
at certainly i'm not trying to diminish bu impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not youre into met adversity but how aryou'r going to meet it
so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
and we do a di service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
there isan important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputi and the subjective socital opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
and truthfully the only real and consistent dissibility i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognoses
or indeed aprognosis on the expected quality of their lifes we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
disable somebody perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how to we fix it
serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
we are esfactivly grading some one's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
and most importantly there is a partnership between those perceived efficiencies and our greatest creative ability
so it's not about devaluing or neggating me's more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
wracked in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
embracing it grappling with it the y's a wrestling term may be even dancing with it
and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful were less burdened by the presence of it
this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwine and it was a hundred fifty years ago when wriding about evolution the darwine illustrated i think a truth about the human character
to paroprase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
conflict is the genisis of creation from darwine's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit threuwgh conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
human skill and perhaps you know untill we're tested we dont know we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
so we can give ourselves a gift we can reimagine adversity and something more than just tough times
maybe we can see it is change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves too yet
i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalty
and who's normal there 's no normal there's common there's typical
thre is no normal and would you wan to meet that poor base person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradime from one of
achieving normalty to one of possibility or potency do we even a ltlbit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
theyare rare and valuable abilitiis with the community antherpologis tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
there 's evidence that neander thaults sixty thousand years ago carried they are elderly and those with serious physical injury
and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
a few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up and that redzoan and north eastern pensylvania
and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i heard this gy his voice behind me say well if it isn't ame in mullins
i turn around and is his older man i have no idea who is and i said ah i'm sorry sir i don't
have we met i i don't remember meeting you you sai will ou woulnt remember meeting me we when we met i was delivering you from your mother's woom
so o  me oh that gy i's no mot amd of course actually
it did click this man was doctor kean a man that i had only known about throuh my mother's stories of that day because of course
thypical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks and so my mother's prenadale physician had gone on vacasion so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
and because i was born with aut the sibla bones and had feet turned in and a few toes on this foot n a futosan tat he had to be the bearer the stranger
had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
and youwould never have the kind of nobility that other kis have or any kind of life of independence and you'v been making a lier ata me ever since
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
whether winning as second grade spelling b marching with the girl scowds you know the holloweam prade winning my collag scholarship or any of my sports victories
and he was using it in integrating it into teaching a resident students med students from hanamen
medical school and hurtey medical school and he called this part of the corse the ex factor ther was t potential of the human will
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be in that as a determinate in the quality of some one's life
and doctor king went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
and even if given a matama modicum of support is left to their own devices a child will achieve
to doctor kene made that shift and thinking he understood that thre 's a difference between the medical condition and what some one might do with it
andthere's been a shift in my thinking over time and that if you had ask me at fifteen years old if i would have trayed it prothetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
i aspired to that kind of normal sy back then wodif yo ask me today i'm not so sure
and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
to all you really need is one person to show you the apifiny of your own power and your off if you can hand somebody the key
to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for some one at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
you're teaching them to open doors for themselves exactthe exact meaning of the word educate
comes from the rouotword educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out patential so again which potential do we want to bring out
ther was a case study done in nineteen sixty's breaton when they were moving from compria grammar schools to comprehensive chools called the streaming triales we call it tracking
here in the states its separating students from  b s d nd so on
and yo know the ay students get the toper coriculum the best teachers ec cetera while they took over a thee month period de level students gave the mase told them they were as told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
they were performing at a level and of course the harp breaking flipside of the study is that they took the ay students
and told hem they were deas and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around an school bsides the drot people had dropped out
tisses the crucial part of of this caystudy was that the teachers were duped too
the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the asuns these are the deastudents and that's how they went about teaching them
and treating them though i think
hath the only true disibility
is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity in our inate ability to imagine
if instead we can boster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet name hopic
and my friend jocdambas told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
has known god not the god of names not the god of donts but the god who only knows four words
and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
how an i talk to day about energy and climate
and that might seem a bit surprising because mifull time work of the foundation is mostly about vaxins and sceeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest tubillion live better lives
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet
the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow her'll be too much reaign not enough reign
things will change in ways that their feragul environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them
also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lor of the pricob to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down overtime
o really a advance civilization as based on aadvances in in energy the cold revolution fuweled
the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity an that's why we have erfrigerators air conditioning we can make o modern materials ind do so many things
and so were int a wonderful situation with a electricity in the rich world
but as we make a cheaper and let's say let's go for making it a twices cheap we need to meen a new constraint
and that constraint has to do with seo tu seo tu is warming the planet
and the ocquasionon seo to is actually a very straight forward one if you sum up the seo too that gets abmitted
that leads to a temperature increase and that temprature increase leads to some very negative effacts the effects on the weather
a perhaps worse the indirect effacts in that of the natrallegal systems cant ajust to these rapid changes and so you get echo system colopses
now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase in ofsio to
to what temperaturewill be in wear the positive febacks art there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
i asked the top sientist and as several times do we really have to get down to near zer can't we just and 'll cut itin a half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero
the temperature will continue to rise and so that's that's a big challenge it's very different than saying in a word twelve foot high truck tryin to get under a ten foot bridge and we can toa sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero
now we put out a lot of carpendioxide every year i'll over twenty six billion tons offer each american
it's about twenty tuns ah for people in poor countries it's less than one ton tsan average about five tongs for every one on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that we'll bring that down to zero
it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have evend flatened it a all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zerol this ocquasion as or factors
a little bit of multiplication so you got a thing on the left seo too that you want to get to zero and that's gin to be based on the number o people
the services each person josing on average the energy on average preach service and the seo too being put out
a purt unitov energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this tout into zeyro a probably one of these numbers is gen i have to get pretty near to zero
a that's back from a high school algegrub but let's let's take a look ah first we've got population
now the world to day has six point eight billion people that's head ed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on newbackscenes health care
reproductive held services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen per cent but there we see an increase of  about one point three
the second factor is the services we use this incompases everything the food we
clothing tv a heating these are very good things a getting rid of poverty means providing these servicees to almost every one on the planet and it's a great thing
a for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use lus but every year
this number on avrage is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person
here we have a very basic service do you have lightin in your house to be able to read your home warkand in fact these kids don'ts o the're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps
now efficiency  the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's nock going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting
a throug a different types of cars a different ways of building buildings there a a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially
some individual services even bring it down by ninety per cent there are other services like how we make ferlizer how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
and so over all here if ore obtimystic we may get a reduction of a a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex
but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billions to it best a maybe thirteen billion tuns and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's gon to be a key one
and this is the amount of seo tu put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can't you actually get that to zero ah if you burn coal
no af you burn aptorgaskan almost every way we maye electricity to day ah except o for the emerging runobles and newclear ou puts out seo too and so we're going to have to do it a global scale
is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i is the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible
the micer processor is a miracle the personal computers a miracle o the innernetnant servicees are a miracle so the people here of perticipated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a dead line
were we' have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and som com along some don't this is a case where we actuly have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a a pretty tight time line
now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of naptural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow o people enjoyed that
it really got them involved in the idea ah you no other people who live in the squitos so with energy i like to come upwit is this ah i decided that relleasing fireflies
would be my a contribution to the invironment here of this yeare so here we ave a somenowt reply flies i'm told they don't biht in fact they might even not even leave that jar ah
now ther's all sorts of gimik solutions like that one ah but they don't really ad up too much we need solutions either one or several that have
unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there 's many directions or people seeking i really only see five that
can achieve the big numbers i've left out tie ulthermal fusian viaphuls those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here
is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them ah because they they look daunting because they all
have significant challenges ill let's look first at the burning postl fuels either o burning coal or burning naptral gass what you nean to do there
seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the seo too after you've burnt it going out the fle preshris it cradel liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
now we have some pilot things that do this that the sixteet eighty percent lavel but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a greenom weare these seo to quantitis should be put
i'll be hard but the topas one here is this long tremisue who's gin to be sure who's going to garran tea
a something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of newclyor other things this is a lot a volume
so that's a top one next a de nuglir it also has three big problems clost particlian highly regulated countries as high
the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that he din tot you have these human operators that the fuel
doesn't get used for weapons and then where it what do you do with the waste although it's not very large al tere a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tomp problems  that might be asolvable and so should be worked on
the last three of the five i've grouped together ah these are what people often referr to is the renewable sources and they actually
although it's great they don't requile fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the dencity
h energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming
seare talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than than you think of its a normal energy plant also these are intermitant sources athe sun doesn't shine
all day itdoesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so f you depend on these sources
you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here
ah we have transmission challenges for example sav this energy sourceis outside your country ah yu not only need the technology but you have to a deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storiage problem
and to dimantinalize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computors for foms for flash lights for everything and compared that
to the amount of electicl energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes
of all the energy and so in fact we need a big break through here something that's going to be
a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the intermentan source to be above say twenty to thirty per cent
of what you're using if you're counting on it for a hundred per cent you need a anincredible miracle battery
now how are ging to go forwaird on this what's what's the right approach is it a ban hant an project what's the the thing that can get us there what we needs wants
of companies a working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need  least a hundred people and lot of im youll look at and say they're crazy that's good
and i think here in the ted group we have many people ah who are already pursuing this ah
pill gros hav several companies in clem one called eas soler that has some great soler thormal technology a van od cosas in vesting an dozens of conpanies ah that a're doing great things and have a interesting possibilities and i'm i'm trying to help back that a nathe meribale than i actually are backing a company
that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the newclear approach of there are some inevations in newcleiar mogler liquid
ah an inevation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around ah is not all that surprising the ide of a terro power
is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one per cent of jusyeu to thirty five we decided will let's burn the ninety nine per cent
the yeu tu thirty eighth it is kind of a crazy idean in fact people had talked about it for a long time
but they could never stimulate properly whether it would work or not and so it's through the advent of modern super computers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right
material's approach ah this a looks like it would work and because you'r burning that ninetie nine per cent a you have
a greatly improved cost a profile you actually burn up the waste and you can act useas fuel all the left over waste from todays reactors andso instead of warring about them you just take that it's a great thing
it breeds this uranium as it goes along so t kiny like tha candle and sees its alogthera often referred to us a travelling wayvreactor and terms a ful
now this really solves the probem i've got a picture here of a place in contaki this is the left over the ninety nine per cent where they'v taken out the part they bure now so's called to pleaded juranium that would power the you ask
for hundreds of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process youd have enough fuwl for the entire lifetime on the rest of the planet so
you know it's got lots lots of challenge as i had but it is an example of the many hundreds ond hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
sol let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card i'll look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and and then i'll look at the intermediate for twenty fifty you've heard many people talk about
this eighty percant reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by
things going on in poor countries still some agriculture ol hoply we will have cleaned up a forest re simant a so to get to that eighty per cent the developed countries
including countries like china we'll have had a swuitch their electri electriity generation all to gether ah so the other great is are we deploying
this zeromission tecnology have we deployed it in all the develope countries and were in the processos of getting it out elsewhere that' superimportant
at's a key element of making that report card so backing up from there let you the twenty twenty report card look like
well itagain it should have the two elements ad we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the lest we amit the last that sum will be of siotu and therefore the last the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there
doing things that don't get us all the way to the big redoctions is only equallyer may be even slightly less important than the other which is the pieace of inevation
on these break throughse these break throughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulartory things that have been changed
ther's a lot of great books that meem written about this the algor book our choice and the david makai book su stain oble energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think angreat of a frame work that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this
other's a lota the house to come together so this is a wish it's a very concreet wish that
we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifth years i can pick whose president i can pick of acceme
which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no sio two gets invented
this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish the division between the people who think short termn long ter will be terrible
between youis and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lifes of those two billions will be far worse so what do we have to do what am my appealing a tyu de a step forward and
and drive we needed  to go for war research funding and when countries get together at places like copan hagin teyshen
justiscost the sio too they should discuss this inovation of genda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously lo level suspending
on these inivative approaches we neent do need the market in centits seo tutaxs capantrades something that gets that price signal out there
we need to get the message out we need have this dialogu be a more rashon al more understandable dialogue a including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you
tak yo tank yo
thank you asit to understamd more about about ta terapala right a
weonpfessor wwa can give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this ays
but to to actually do this soft were by the supercompudor hier all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out
ah in a russianryactor to make sure that ar materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions the tothing is building the pilot reactor
a finding the saverobillion a finding the the regulator the location that will actally build the first one of these one should get the first one built
if it works as advertise then it's ust clear as day because the economics the energudensity are so different than newcler as we know it
and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almos like like a verticle knd of colum of nuclier fl of this sortof spanouraniam and then an then and then the presces starts at the top and  kin of works down
that's right to day you're always refuling the reactoracy of lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing wereyo're opening it up and moving things in and out that's
that's not good so if you han't bery very cheep fuel then you can put sixty years end just think of it is a log
put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixth years ah and and then it's done
it's its anu cleer paprontha is its own wist disposal solution
yelo wud hammens with the waiste you can you can let it sit there ah there's a lot less waiste under this approach ah then you can actully take that and put it into another one and burn that
and and we start out acty by teaking the waste that exists today that sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors that's our ful
to begin with so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed ind ars and you're reducing the volume of the wayst quite dramatically as you're going through this process
antyou'r talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where wheare is theire most interest in actually doing something with this
well we haven't ah picked a particular place but ah and there's all these a interesting disclosure rules a bout anning that's called nuklir
so i wewe've got a lot of interest ah the people from the company hav ben in rusia india china i've been back sein the secretary of energyou hear or talking about how this
ah fits in to the the energeogenda sa noptomystic ah into the prancin japanese of donsemorgthis is a avariant on something that has been done it's an important
advance but it's like a fast ractor in a lot of compcountries to built them so anybody use donafastractor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built
so in in your mind am time scale and likelihood arv actually taking cetin lighte their slive
what we need for one of these
hy scale or electric electrcal generation things that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that sort of the dead line
that the environ models environmental modls of have have shown us that we have to meat and in otera power if things go wal
o which is wishing for lot could easily meet that and there are a fortunately now dozens of companies we needbe hundreds
who likewise if their cience goes well if the funnin for their pliant pilot plants goes well that they they can compeep for this and it's bast if multible succeed because then ou to use a mix amixt these things we certainly need wont to succeed
maintoms of big scale or possible game changes tthisis the biggest that you are aware of out that
an energy break through is the the most important thing it would have been even without the envire mentalcome sfrin but the inviroemelancones frate just makes thit so much
so much greater in the new cleaer space there are other enevators ah nof we don't know there wer as well as we know this one but
the modgeler people ow that's a different approach there's a liquid typry actor which seems little hard bumaybe they say about us
and so there there are different ones but the the beauty of this is a molcue of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molicule of say coal
and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprinting cost the patential ind terms of effect on land and varies things is in almost iny class of its own
if this doesn't wok
thenwhat do we have to stop taking imugincy measures to try and keep the temperature of the eath stable
yet if you' get into that situation it's like
if youre
you've been over eating and you'reabout t have a hartattack and on then then then where do you go you may need heard surger something there is a line of research on what's called ge angineerian
which are various technicues that would delay the heeding to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together
now you hope that's just an entrance palsy you hope you don't need to do that some people say you shoun even work on the intrance palscy because it might make you
lazy that you'll keep eating because you know heart sirgeryi'll be there to save you i'm not sure that's wis given the importance of the problem but
ah theres now that the geoingineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this inevation goes a lots slower than we expect
climate skeptics if you had dem a sentence or two to say to them how how might you persuade them that they are wong
well unfortunaely the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few
in are they saying that there's nagative feed back effects have to do with clouds that off sat things they're very very few things that they can even say in ol there's a chance and a million of those things the main prim you have here
it's kind like aids  you make a mistake now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now
that how to do it ta gain later in is somewhat uncertain a painting in fact the ipe se sea report you no that
that's not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the ritrol to look at ipisese and say ocay you kno that that isn't that big of veal the fact is its that uncertain part
that should move us towards us but my dream here is that if you can make it acanomic anne meet the sio to constraint then the sceptic saoca
i don't care that it doesn't put outsio to i kind i wish it did put out seo tou but i guess i'll except it causet's cheeper
tat autrigt what's come before
o
and so that woul be yor response to the tha the biyn lamborg argument that basitly if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve the seer too problem is con to take away all your other golls of trying to rid the world of poverty an milaryan ser for this its it is it is tha stupid waste of the irth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do
yet ol the actual spending on the arndpiece a you on say th you i should spend ten billiiar more than it is right now it's not that dramatic it shouldn't take away from other things the thing you get into big money on
and this reasonable people can discrease when you have somesnonic annomich and you're trying to fund that that to me mostly is a waste unless you're very close in you're just funnyin the learning curbin it's goin to get very cheep i believe we should try in a more
a things that have a patential to be far less expensive if the traid off ye get into is let's make energys super and super
a expensive then the rich con afford that mean all of us here could pay five times as much for or energy and not change our life style
the disaster is for that tubillion and even lanborg has changed ah his stick now is whysan thearnd
ah getting more disgust he hes still because it his earlier stoffs sort of associate with the sceptic camp but he's realized that's that's a pretty lonely camp and and so
ah he's making the arin dee point and and so there is a a a threat of something that a i think i's appropriate the arin dee piece it's crazy how little it's fundo
will bill i suspect i a speak a barf of most people here ah to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much
hank give
so i've known a lot of fish in my life
i've loved only too
at first one was that
it was more like a passionate affair
it was a beautiful fish
flavorful taxcared
medy a bast sallar on the menu what a fish
even better it was farm raised to the supposeed highest standards of sustainability
seak if ye'll goot about selling it
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months
one day the head of the company called and asked if i'd speak out an event
bout the farms sistain ability absolutely i said
here's a company trying to solve
what's become this unimaginable problem for a sheps
how do we keep fish on our menus
for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas
like we clear cut forres
it's hard to overstraigt the destruction
nine ty per cent a large fish the ones we love the tun as the hallobets the sammons swordfish the clept tallwas nothing left
so for better for worse acquiculture fish farming seery part of our future
a lot of arguments against it
fish farms balup
most of them do anyway and tey're inefficient take tunam the major draw back
is got a feed conversion rasio a fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tona
not very sustainable done tayes very good either
so herefinally
was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support him
the day before the evant i called they head a piare for the company
what's call him don
down i sa jus to get the facts traiht you gies are famous for from farming so far out to sea you you don't palute that's right he said we're so far out
the waste from our fish gets distributed
not concentrated and then he added
ore basically a world unto ourselves
a fee conversin racio two point five to on he said best in the business
too point fithe on grat the to pon five wet what wuld if eedn sustain amol protins he said
great i said got off upon
and that night i was lying in bed i thought
what the howl is a sustainable approcin
so the next day just before the event i called don i sad down what are some examples of sustainable protins sad he didn't know
they would ask around whele i got on the fall ofthe few people on the company no one could give me a straiht answer
until finally i got on the fone with the head biologist
wet's call him down too
i'm don i said what are some examples of sustainable protings
whel he mentions some alges
and some fish meals and then he said chicken palets
as a chicken pots ye said y father's skain
boanmeal scraps dried and prosces thin de feat
said what percanage
of your feed is checken
thanking in o two per cent
at's about thirty per can he said
a sen done
what's the stayn a bull about feeding chickin to fesh
u there is a long paws on the line
and he said there's just too much chicken in the world
i fell out of love with this fish
no not because i'm som self rightous goody shoe shoes foody
actuallyam
and i fell out of lovewith this fish because i swere i got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken
this second fesh
bu it's a different kind of love story
it's the romantic kind
the kind wear the more you get to know your fish you'll love the fish
i first aidet at a restauant in southern spain
a jornalist frand had been talking about this fish for a long time
shicana set us up
i it came to the table abright
almost shimmering white color
the sheff had overcooked it like twice over oka amazingly it was still delicious
who can make a fish taste good
after it's been overcooked
i can't but this gi can't
let's call him me gale actually his name ismegale
i know he didn't cook the fash and he's not a shaft at least in the way that you and i understand it
he's a biologist
at vectalapamma it's a fish farm in the south western corner of spane
it's at the tip of the guadalicavir river
until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians
they raised beef cattle ammal was assentially wet lancs
they did it by draining land they built this intricate series of canals
and they pushed water off the land and out into the river
whil hey couldn't make it work not economically
and echologically it was a disaster
killed like ninety percent of the birds which for this place i the lotto birds
and so in nineteen eighty two
a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchase the land what did they do
they were verse the flow of water they literally flipped the switch
set a pushing water out
they used the channels to pull water back in they flouttered the canals
they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fon
bas mollyd shrimp eel
any in the process migal and this company
completely reversed the echological destruction
the farm's incredible i'mn you've never seen anything like this
he stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are fluttered canals and this thick rich marsh lam
i was there not long ago with me ye
he's an amazing gy
like three parts charles darin and one part crocadyle dunde
o gak
there we are flogging through the wet land
and om panting and sweating at mudd up to my knees and me gale is calmly conducting a biology lecture
here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kipe
now i's mentioning
the mineral needs the fighto plang them
and here here he sees a grouping patder the reminds him of the tanzinian geraf
it turns out mi gale spent the better part of his career in the macoommi national park in africa
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish said fish
might a now anything about fish
i'm an expert in relationships
and then he's off
launching into more talk about rayre birds and alges and strange a quatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinate you know the biatic community unplugged cannethan you know 'sgrape
but i was i lup and my head
was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before so i interrupt end mi sent me gown what makes your fish taste so good
we pointad the algey
i knowdo the algy the fight o plang then the relationship sits es amazing
right bu what ae your fish eatint and what's the feed comversion racia
weu goes on to tell me
it's such a rich system
that the fish are eating what they beating in thewild
the plant byal mask to fight up mine the zoop lines and it's what feeds the fish the system is so healpy it's totally self for newing
there is no feed
ever heard of a farm the dozen feet its animals
later that day i was driving round this property with me galin i asked him aself for a place it seemed so natural
unlike any fish for aleganty farm i'd ever been at
withow do you measure success
at that moment it's as if a film director called for a sect change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingus
a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see
that success he said
look at their balleys pink they're feasting
cheasting as tally confes i said  me ge aent they fasting on your fish
yes he said
we lose twenty percan of our fish and fish eggs to birds
i will last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it
more than two hundred fifty different species it's become to day the largest
and one of the most important
private bird sanctuaries in all of europe
i sein to me gale isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fishfarm
he shook his head now he said
we farmd extensively
not intensively
this is an ecological net work
the flumingoes eat the shrimp the shrimpeap the fihto plank an so the pinker the belly the better the system
look ats  let's review a farm tha dozen feet its animals
an a farm that measures its success
on the health of its preditors
a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary
oh and by the way those flemingas they shouldn't even be there in the first place
they brode in a town a hundred an fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nest
every morning they fly one hundreda fifty miles into the farm
and every evening they fly one hunr or fifty miles back
they do that because they're able to follow the broken whihte line of highway e ninety two
no getting
now i was imagining a march of the penguins theng you know so i looked at me galle i said
me gal do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm
and then do they fly one hundr ad fifty miles back at night
do they do that for the children
he looked at me like i just quartered a witme hustan saw
he said no they' do i cas the food's better
o i didn't mantion the skin of my beloved fish
which was delicious and i don't like fish skin i don't like it seered i'm a like it chrispy
is that accorid tarlike flavor
i must never cook with it
yet when i tasted it at that restarant in southern span it tasted not at all like firskin
a tasted sweet and clean
like you were taking a bite of the ocean
i mentioned that to megalan he nodded he said the skin as like a spunge s a last e fence before anything enters the body it ivolved
to soak up impurities and then he added
but our water has no impurities
oka a farm the dozen feet its fish
a farm the measures is success
by the success of its preditors
and then i realize when he says
a farm that has no impurities he made a big under statement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the guatelic of your river
s a river that carries with it all the things the rivers tend to carry these days
chemical contammonents pestaside run off
and when it works its way through the system
and leaves the water it's cleaner than wen it enter
the system is so healthy it purifies the water
so not just a farm tha dozen feet its animals not just a farm tha measures the health
they had success by the health of its preditors
but a farm that's literally all water purification plant
and not just for those fish
but for you and me as wealth because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic
a drop in the ocean i know but i'll take it and so should you
because this love story
however romantic is also instructive
you might say it's aracipy for the future of good food
whether were talking about bass or beef cattle
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good
but for a lot of people
that's a big too radical
we're not realists aspudes
were lovers
we love farmer's markets we love small family farms
we talk about local food wead organic
and when you suggest these are the things that will in shore
the future of good food some one some where stands up and says hega
alo thank flemmngas but how youdon't fee the world
hawaguntopeed the worlds can i be honest i don't love that question
no not because we already produce anoff calleries to more than feed the world
one billion peepal
we'll go hungry to day one illion that's more than ever before
because of gross in equalities and distribution not tunishe
hat i don't love this question because it's the term an the logic of our food system for last fifty years
feed grained arbavorse
pest te sides to monocultures chemicals to soil chickened a fish
and all long agrabusiness has simply asked
if for feeling more people more cheeply how terrible could that be
that's been the motive ation speend the justification it's been the business plant
of american agriculture we shul call itwhat it is
a business and liquidation
a business that's quickly a roating ecological capital that makes that very production possible
a souht of business and his agriculture
our bread basket is threatened to day not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertil land
not by pumps but by fresh water
not by chain saws but by forres and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the seak wont of mo the world
let's start by asking how we one to feet ourselves
or better how can we create conditions that enable every community
defeed its elf
to do that don't look
at the agrabusus model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's highon capital camistry and machines
and it's never produced anything really good to
instead let's look to the achological mottle
that's the one that relies on two billion years
of on the job experience
farms that aren't worlds unto themselves
farms that
restore instead of depleet farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively
farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships
cas there the ones
they're experts in flavour too
and if i'm goin to be really honest
there are better chaft than i'll ever bi
you don't lokaye it that
because if that's the future of good food it's gon to be delicious thank you
everybody talks about happiness these days
i had somebody counce the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years
and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researches there is a lot of happiness colching everybody would like to make people happier
but in spite of all this flood of work there are several coof traps that would have make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness
and my talk to day will be mostly about these conglive traps thus applies to lay people thinking bof their own happiness and it ap plice to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out where just as mes stopp as anybody elses
the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity turns out that the word happiness is just not a youthful word any more because we applied to too many different things
i think there is one particular meaning forto which we might restrict it but by and large this as something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is
the second trap is a confusion between experience ind memory maseclets between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and tare both lump in the notion of happiness
and the third is it's the folcasing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that effects well being without distorting its importance anin this is a real cogetive trap there is just no way of getting it right
now i'd like to start with an example of somebody
whed a question and answer assertion after one of my lectures
reported a story and that wer the story he said he had been listening to a syinphany
and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added greading quite emotionally
it ruined the whole experience
but the tabdents
when it had ruined where the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep
when this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selvs ah there is an experiencing self
who lives in the present
and knows the present 's capable of reliving the past abasicly it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor us does it hurt now when i thought true here
and then there is a remembering self
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score
and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor
approachers in asking the question
how have you been feeling lately o how as your trip to obanio something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self
and te and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of amess about the notion of happiness
now the remembering self
is a story teller and that really starvs with a basick
response of our memories starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story
and let me begin with one example
thus es an old study those are actual patients under going a painful procedur a on going to detail it's no longer painfor these days but it was painful whin thesix when this study was run in t nineteen nineties
there ars the report of their pagn every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their their recordings and who are asked
who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question a inclearly patient be suffered more ifs colonoscopy was longer and everyem
minute of pain that patient a had patient bhad and more but now there is another question
how much did these patients think they suffered
and here is a surprise
and the surprisis that patient a had a much worse memory of the olonoscopy than patient by the stories of the colonosopies were different
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is thisthinc but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse if the one where pain was let its speak at the very end
it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscope and much later too how bad was the whole thing intotal and it was much worse for a than forbee in memory
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the rememberingslf from the point of you of the experiencing self clearly be had a worse time
now what you could do with patient a and we actually ranclynical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoskopy of patient a by just keeping the toubin without driggling it too much that will
that will cause the patient to suffer bu dressed a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencingself of patient a worse off
and you've made the remembering self of patient a a lot better off because now you have endowed patient a
with a better story about his experience
what thet finds te story
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up when ther finds a story aur changers significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominateit
now the experiencingself lives its life
continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straight forward
they are lost for ever me most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know tho psychological presents is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know and in ar life they areabout six hundred millions of them in a months ther re about six hundred thousand
most of them don't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self
and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count
that what happens during these moments of experience is our life
it's the finight resorse that we are spending while we are on this earth
and how to spend it would seem to be relavant but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us so we have the
rememberingself and the experiencing self and they are really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time
from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vication and the second week is dust as good as the first then
the two week vication is twice as good as the one week vocation  that's not the wayit works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vocation is barely better
than the one week vocation because they'r ane known new memories added you have not trained the story
and in this way time is actually the critical variable the distinguishes a rememberingsof from our experiencing so time has very little impart on the story
now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions
because if you have a patient wo has had say to colonoscopies with two different surgions and is deciding which or them to chrose then
the one that cruses in the one that has en ol the memory that is less bad and that's the truth the surgeon that will be chosen
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't chose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future
we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories
and basictly you can look at the unisa tyrany of the remembering self
and you can think of the remembering sof sort of dragging the experiencing self to experiences that experiencing self does'meed
i have that sense that when we go on vocations this is very frequently the case that is that it's
we we go onvocations to a very large extent in the service of a remembering self
and this is a bit how to druss the fire thig ory na
how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanation that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and
when i think about that i think about af vecation we had in intoctic o a few years ago which was clearly the bestlication of ete hart and i think of it raterlly often
relative to how much i think of other vacations and
i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if if i had ever opened the falder with the six hundred pictures in ite i would have spent another hour
now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half
there seems to be a discrepency ow i may be a bit extreme in o inhow little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more ofverse
there is a genuine question
why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thort experiment
imagining that for your extlication you know that at the end of the tthe vecation all your pictures will be destroyed
and you'll get an anisi drug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vocation
and and if an if you would choose a different vocation
there is a conflict between your two sells and you need to think about how to adudicate that conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time
then you get one answer and if you think in terms of of memories you might get another answer
why do we bak them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know whither choice between the two sells
now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness there e really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one perself
and a so you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy of the moments in the experiencing self life
and there are happiness for moments as a fairly complicated process what ar the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of
getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time
if you ask for the happiness of the rememberingself it's a completely different thing that as not about how happyly a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life
very different notions any one who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mesup the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of well being
who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization has a world pol with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about
their experiences and ther there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is ar they are really different
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily thei'r living their life
and visversa youn or just to give you sense of the correlation the correlation is about point five with that means as if you met somebody and you were told or his father is six feet tall
whow much would you know about this height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody
rank their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self
so the correlation is low we know something about what control satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important golds are very important we know that happiness is mainly
being satisfied with people that we like
spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures but thisis dominent so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selvs you are going to end up doing very different things
the bottom line of what i've said here is that we really should not think of happiness a as a substutes for well being it is a completely different notion
now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that
we do not attend the sent to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california
you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in culifornia if if say you live in ohayo ah and
and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places
and that contrast says inclimate whell it turns out the climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that besides how happy people are
but now because the reflective self is in charge
you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to californian the hope of getting happier
well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that
but one thing will happen they will think they are happier
because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio
and they will feel they made the right decirsion it is very difficult to think straight about well being and
i hope i have given you sense of how difficult it is thank you
i give tat i oo ot to di
thank thank you so much now when we are on the fon am few weeks ago am
you mentioned to me that a there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallop' serve
is that is it somny that you can share since you do have a few moments lefnow
short ah i think the most interesting resolv that we found in the gallops of is is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found out with respect to the happiness of the experiencing selfh
when you no we looked at how inhor feelings very withincome
and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it's  lod representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year
ficfifty thousand
sixty fhousand
sixty thousand eson sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they yet progressively unhappy of the poor er vigiet above that we get an absolute ly flat line i mean i've really seen lyine so flat
clearly what havs happened is money does not bu you experientral happiness but lack of money certainly buys your misery
and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of this
the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you are the more satisfied your that does not hold for emotion
but doni vi the unwhole american endeavor is about in a life liberty of the pursuit of happiness
if people took seriously that fineding amit it seems to tun upside down everything we believe about
wen i might for example taxation policy and so forth is there is there any chance that politicians that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it
ou know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness resutr in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the yuke it is happening and in other countries it is happening
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of public policy
's going to take a while and it's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happinus or whether they want to study life i valuations o we need to have tha debate fairly soon how to inhance happiness
goes very different ways depending and how you think on whether you think of the rememberingself wor you think of the experiencingself this is going to influence policy i think in he is to come in the united states efforts are being made
to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decado to part of national statistics
while it seems to me that this issue well or at least should be
the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next es thank you so much for inventing behaviour economics
acte delycon
for some time i have been interested in the placibo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is a something vake
is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real an other words chugerpills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies ah the posebo effect just because the person thinks
that what's happening to them is a farmar sutacle or aa some sort of a for pain management for example if they believe it enough there's a measurable effect in the body called the posebo effect something fake becomes something real because of some one's perception of it
ah in order for us to understand each other i want a start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i mus show you how at works this a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least e nineteen fifties ah i learned myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies
i i'll do it for you and then i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explain it caxbe so i heres it happens knife which you could examine my hand whic you could examine
i cani' hold the knife and my fists like this ii'll get my sleeve back and ought to make sure nothing goes upor down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here i
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i am squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve and the object of this is quite simple
ah i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well
my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it
and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve th's no trickeryng and you can examine everything cata
so this a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this vary even thohs a very simple trick methoologically probably many of you in the room know this trick a what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand
i say im going to grab hold of my risk to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i'm holding on to my rist is because that's actually the secret
of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger id hear my indects fingers juscan ashift from where it is to a position
finding out like this i
nice sward
some one who didn't have a childhood is out theres
soi does like this from here i and as i move around my finger shifs and we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in the way it processis information it doesn't count one to three it groups them but that's not really what this is about right then i open my hand obviously its clinging there not by animal magnetism but by
cicanory my innext finger being there and then when i closed my finger the same thing as i move back
this motion can have covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there's a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors an thaks now
what oes that have to do with the proceble effect well
i read a study ah a year or so ago that really blue my mind wide open i'm not a doctor or a research or so this to me was an astonishing thing
turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like a aspran shaped just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the pacebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective
even though neither one of these things has any farme suitable quits their shuger pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill lilila what
that really flit me out turns out though that that's not even where it stops if you ar have capsles
the're more effective than tablets in any form a colored capistle that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capstle dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills
i don't remember this totisticnansfu but the point is
these dosages have somethingto do with it and the form has somethingand if you want the ultermate in a plocebo you' go to the needle
right a surynged with some innert couple sea seas of some innerts something and you inject this into a patient whille this is such a powerful image in their mind that it is so much stronger than the white pill as it really this graff ona well ill show ite f some other time when we have slides the point is
the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capistel is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real a farmer sutical quality it's only your belief that makes it real
in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a pake trick and make it seem real
and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hat pin it's very very sharp
and iam going to just starelize at a tiny bit ca
this is really my flesh this is not damian's special grown flesh that's my skin right there this is not a holly with special effect i am going to pierce my skin and a run this needle through to the other side
if you're queezy if you're if you faint easl i was doing this for some friends in the a hotel room last night andsome people that i didn't know and one woman almost past out so i suggest if you're me if youd get queesy easy that look awave for about the next thirty in fact iu know aunt i'll do the first bad part behind ityou'll get to see you can look away too if you like to
ah so here's what happens right here a the beginning of my flesh ah at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce
i'm sorry maa hi i might freeking you out ok and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this
now essentially were in the same position we were in with the knife trick
a sort of
but you can't count my fingers right now canyo smeth sell me show em to you that's ane two three for five asma
i know what people think when they see this they go well he would certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes
som my give you a little peak
as that look out there petty good
yei no
and the people in the back ooca i didn't really see ha people in sadleihte room or like starting to move in now me give you a good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a holly woot special effect that's my flesh
and i can twist that around i'm sorry idon' if you're getting qweezy look away don't look at her thing
people in the back ar people on vitio years from now watching a sigowl ye that looks kind of neat and n
some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be seen as a whole there in a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding
i me work up some blood for him
ss
normally now i would take the needle out i would clean ofth my arm and i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of
taking something phake and making it into something real i'm jut going to leave it there and walk off the stage
i will be seeing you several times ovr the next few days i hope you're looking forward to that thank you freve
if i can leave you with one big idea to day it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information overlowed
what i'd like you to think about is how we can use information to that pattern's pop and we can see trins that would otherwise be invisible so what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age this
tool that i'm musing here is a little experiment is called pivet and with pivet what i can do is i can choose to filter on one particular cause of death say accidents and right away i see there's a different pattern that emergeus
this is because in the midere here people are their most active and overheare ther their most frail we can step back out again and then reorganize the day that by cause of death
seeing that circulatory diseases and cansers are the usual souspects but not for every one if we go ahead and we fill ter
by age say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about
and be driln to that its especially the case from that so you get the idea that viewing information doing gate in this way is a lot like
swimming and anliving information and vograpic and if we can do this for raw data why not do it for content as well
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sport illustratit ever produced
it's all here it's all in the web you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk with piofit you can drill into a deckade you can drill into a particular year you can jump right into a specific issue
so i'm looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue the spords i'm a land's armstrong fan so i'll go ahead and alcook on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lancs armstrongas been apart of
now if i wanted just cind of take a peak at these i might think well what about taking look at all of cichling so i can step back and expand on that and i see gruggla mand now
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrow broader bcking and backing out you're not searching you'r not browsing you're doing something that's actually a little biddifferent it's ind between an
we think it changes the way information can be used so i wonto extrapulate on this idea bit with something that's a little the crazy what we've done heres we've taken every single wiccapetia page and we reduced it down to a little sommrin so the sommery consist of just little synobsis and a i con to indicate the topical airia that it comes from i'm only showing the top five hundred most popular wiccapetia pages right here but even in this limited view
we can do a lot of thanks right away we get a sense of whatare the topical domans at our most popular in wicopedia i'm gon to go ahead and slecked government
now having selected government i could now see that the wickapedia catigories that most frequently correspond to that our time magazene people of the year
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikapetia page it's only possible to see that endsiht when you step back at look at all of them looking at one of these particular sumres i can then drill into the consept of
time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them so looking at these feple i can see that the majority come from government
some have come from natural sciences
some few are still have come from business
there's my bos anda
one is come from music
and interestingly enough bone was also ted prise winner
so we can go jump and take a look at all tetprise winters so you see we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web not from page to page but at a higher level of abstraction
and so i want to show you one nother thing that may catch yo litt e bit by surprise i'm just showing the new yor times wept it here so pivat this application i don't want a t call to browser's really not a browser
but you can view wed pages with it and we bring that zumable technology to every single wed page like this so i can step back
pap right back anto a specific section now the reason why this is importance because by virtue of just viewing wet pages in this way i can look it in my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill in to what i've done
over specific time frames here in fact is the state of all the demo that i just gave and i can sort of replay amd stuff that i was looking at earlier to day
and if i wan to step back and look at everything i can sliceen dice my history perhaps by my search history
here i i's doing some nepatistic searching looking for being over here for live laps pivit and from these i can drill in to the wehas and just launch them again it's one meatow for
repurpose multibal times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the dayadie so
right now in this world we think about datas being this curse we talk about the curse of information overlowed we talk about
drowning in dada what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down
so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next we get use to the havit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hid ant if we can do that then instead
of being tract and data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge and of we get the knowledge that ther may be these rom ther's wisdom to be found so  that i thank you
i grew up on steady died of sides fiction in high school i i took a buf to school an hour each way every day and a i was always absorbed in a book
side's fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this ah in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had in and o
you know that curyosity also manifested itself and in them
the fact that whenever i wasint in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking
samples aof frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and ringing it back looking at it under the micrescope i was en all i was reille sidesgak but it was all about trying to understand
understand the world understand the the limits of of possibility and my or love of of ciad's fiction
i actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late sixdys
ah you no we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep otions a jakusto was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in all wondrous world that we could never really have
previously imagined so that seem to resinate with the whole science fiction part of it
and i was a an artist ah i could draw like a paint and and i i found that because there werean't in ovidio games an this saturation of si gi movisan and all of this imagery in the media landscape
i had to create these images in my head out you non't we all did as kids having to a read a book and through the author's description put something on on the screan o the moovy screan in our heads and so my
response to this was to paint to draw alian creatures alian worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in mathclass in o dudling behind the behind the text book and
that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened that the jacusto
shows ah nat yeu got me very excited about the fact that there was an alian world right here on earth i might not really go to an alian world ah on a space ship some day ah that that seemed pretty onpretty darn unlikely
but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth at was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined ah from reading these books
so ah i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only probm with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean
but i didn't let that daunt me ah i pestured my father until he finally found a ascuboclass in in a buffaloo new york reght across the border from where we live
and i acthally got sirdofied ah in a pool at a wyemsie in the dead of winter and buffalo new york and
i didn't see the ocean ah a real ocean for another two years until we thoug we moved to california and nhou since then innonin the in the intervening
forty years ah i've i've spent about three thousand hours under water and five hundred hours of that was insubmercibles and i have learned that that
that that deepochand environment and even the shallow oceans are so a rich and with ta with amazing life
that really is beyond beyond our imagination on nature's imagination is so
so boundless compared to our own a meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is
is on going and and just as strong as it ever was but a i wen i when i chose a creer as an a dult a
it was fill making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges too a trade emages and i was as a kid constantly drawin comic books and son so fill making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that
i chose to tell where since fixion stories terminator alians then the abyss and with the abyss ah i i was putting together my love of under water and diving with film making sop yo
merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abys which was
that to solve a specific narrative problem on that felm which was to create this kind of liquid water creature
ah we actually embraced a computor a generated animation asi gi and
this a this resulted in the first soft surface character see gi animation that was ever in a in a moving
and even though shelln tin make any money i barely broke even i should say i witness something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmorized by this apparent magic in o its arthur clark's law that any sufficiently advanced tecnology as indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical
and so that that gat got me very excited and i thought wow this is this is something it needs to be embraced into the synematic art so with tha terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ialem we created the liquid metal
dued in that filmen that the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result a with an audience altough we didn make a little more money on that way ah so
now drawy a line through those those two two dots of ec of experience came to tes this is gon to be a whole new world this is a whole new world of creativity for
for film artists so i i started a company with stam wenston my good friend stamwinston who is a th the premior make up an encreature designer
ah at that time and it was calle diginal domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog paths the kind of analogu processes of of opticle printers in so nand we would go right to diginal production and we accualy did that anit gave us a competitive advantage for a while
but we found ourselves lagging in the in the midnightes in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do
so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
of a visual effects of si ge effects beyond with realistic a human inmotive ah characters generated in s g in the main characters of obiansgi and the world would be in sige and a
now the emvelop pushed back and i was told by ah athe folks at my company that we weren't gon to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movy about a big ship that sinks
an you no i went and pitch it to the studio as romio and juliet on a ship at skunto be this epic romance passionate
the film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real reck of titanic and that's why i made the move
and that's the true no studio didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we're gon ta dive to the reckwore en a fillment for real will be using it in the opening of the film all be really importatalby a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding and expedition
sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality whose actal crated a reality where six months later i found myself in a russian submercibul
two and half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through avuport natamouvi not ach de forreal
now that that blom y mind and you know i took a lot of preparation we had to build cammers and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this
dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technacle and a required enormous planning and you get in this capsil you go down to this dark hostile a environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself
and ye no i've thought well i'mi'm like living in a science fiction movy this is really cool
and so ii really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean explaration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity t was imagination and it was in experience
that hollywood couldn't give me cause you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions
i was seeing creatures at hydrythernal vancs and and sometimes things that i hadhad never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them so i was completely smitten by this
and had to do more and so i actually made a conacurious decision after the success of titanic i said o canomona park my day job as a holly wood moovin maker an im goin to go  be a full time explorer for a while
and so you on we started planning these these expeditions and we waned up going to the bismark and and exploring it with tha with a robatic vehicles we went back to the titanic rick we took little bots that we had created thi spooled of fibr optic
and hathe idea was to go in indo an interior survey of that ship ah which had never been done nobody ever looked inside di rected idn't have the means to do it so we created tecnology to do it
to you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submerciful and looking out at planks that looked much like this where i knew that the that the band had played
and i'm flying a little robatic vehicle through the through the corridor of thof the ship you kno when i say o  know i'm i'm i'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle
i felt like i was physically present inside the shipreck of titanic and it was e the most serenal canadejavou experience i i've ever had because
i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set fror months when we were making the movy
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blue prints of the ship so ther was this absoltly remarkable experience at it really
made me realize that you' tell the tella presents experience that you actually can have these robotic abatars then your consciousness
is is ininjected into the into the vehicle into this ti other form of existence and was really really quite profound and i may be a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening me o some decades out as a
as we start to have a sideborg bodies for exploration or for other means and in many sort of a post human futures that that i can imagine as a science fixin pam so having done these these a
a expeditions ah and and in a really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vence where we had these
amazing amazing animals the're baty basice alians right here on earth they live in a a environment of kemo synthesis they don't survive
on sunlight based system the way we do and so you're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree senigrade water plums that you think they can't possibly exist at the same time
i was getting very interested in space cience as well again an witc's the science fiction influence as a kid
and i wound up getting involved with ha the space community really involved with tha with nassa sittig on the nassad visry board planning a actual space missions going to russia going through the pre cosmanat biometical proticals and all these sorts of things
to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three dhee carmaus systems and this was fascinating but what what i wond up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep
and taking them down so that they had access ast or biologists planetary scientist people who ware interested in these extreme offile invironments
taking them down to the ventse and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so an so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space sides
i had completely closed the loop between being the scientfiction fan ino as a kid and doing this stuff for real
and in  along the way thain this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about
leadership ow you think directors got be a leader leader of captain the ship all at's hurthing i nerally learn about leadership until
i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this wat o i get out of it
we don't make money at these dam shows ou no we barly break even here' no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails some place u no sitting out the beach  made all these films made all these documentary films that you n't for very
limited audiens o no fame no glory no munny what are you doing you're doing it for the task itself for the challenge
and the ocean is the most challenging invironment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens
when a small group of people form a tightly niptim case we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time
sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realized that the most important thing
is the respect that you have for them that they have for you that youh've done a task
that you can't explain to someone else when you come back to tha shore and you say we now we had to do this and the fibroptic in the attenuation and this an that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea
you can't explain it to people it's that thing that that may be cops have or people in incombat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond ceats a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next movy which was abatar
i tried to apply that same principale of leadership which is that you respect your team and you are in their respect in return and i itreally changed the dinamic so here i was again with a small team
and you know in uncharted territory doing abatar coming up with new technology that didn't exist before tremendously exciting ah tremendously challenging and we became a family
over a four and half year period a completely changed how i do movy so people of comment at on how you now wil you brought back the ochan a organisms and put them on the planita pandoor to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself the changed as a result of that
so what can we sent the size out of all this you know what's the what or the lessons learn well i thinknumber one is curiosity it's the most powerful thing you owne imagination
is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the lorals in the world
and i have young fill mikers
come up to me and say you nl give me some advice for doing this
and i say
don't put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you don't do it to yourself don't bet against yourself and and take risks a anassa hasthis has this a phraise that they like failure is not an optian
but failure has to be an option in art and an explaration because it's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required inovation
was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that's the thought i would leave you with is it in whatever you're doing failure
is an optor but fear is not that you
i'm gam dongl i'm a game designer and i'v been making games on thine now for ten years and a my gold for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in on line games
now i have a plan for this and it intals convincing more people including all of you to spend more time
playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing on line games some of you might be thinking
that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future ait's actually the opposite its true
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems am in fact
i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i have calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of gameplay every week
so that's a probably a bit of accounter into itive idea so i'll just i'll say it again let it sink in an if we want us all problems like hunger poverty climat change global conflict o beacity
i believe that we need to aspire to play aims all mine for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade
no i'm serious
i am here is why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly
this is a portrait by a phetographer name phil toldano he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so he set up a camer in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic
gaming emotion now ah if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the new aunts in this photo you probably see the sense of urgin see a little bit of
fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem am if you are a gamer you will notice a few new aunces here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprise this is a gamer whos on the verge of something called an epic win now an
ah you heard of that o ka good sand we have some gavers among it so an epic win is an oultcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea at was even possible until you achieved it ah it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epiquint
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of some one
who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in every day life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'mnot good at life face and has actually mee
making it can you see it yes good i this s ecully mea making tha i'm not good at life face am thisis a piece of grefety in my old neighborhood in birkly california where i did my peach dee on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful althoug that's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to colabrate and to cooperate and when we're in game worlds
i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves thou most likely to help at a moment's notice thoug most likely to stick woth ta problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again am and in real life
when we when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynicl
we never have those feelings on were playing games they just don existing games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a gried toas sudant what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we
take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaboratave problem soving environment and i started to notice a few things that make
epic winds so possible and all mine worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of the allmine games especially in world of woarcraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission
right away but not just any mission is a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve
but it is on the the verge of what ou're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft there's no sitting around ringing your hands is always something specific
and important to be done an theyeare also tuns of claborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people
ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission as not something we have in a real life that easily the sunset at our finger tips aure tons of colaborators and also there's is epic' story this inspiring story of wh were there
and what we're doing and then we get all this positive fee back you gies have herd of leveling up and plus ones stranth and plus onc's intelligence ol we don't get that kind of constant fee back in real life when i get off the stage i'm no gin to have you know plus one speaking ad plus one
crazy idea a plus twiny crazy idea ah i don't get that fee back in real life ah now the problem with collaborative anl mine of varments like world of warcrowd
is that it's so satisfying to be on the virge of an epiguin all the time that we decide to spend all er time in these gameworlds is just better than reality so so far am collectively all the world of work haf geamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth now
that's not necessarily a bad thin it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when
our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate o hey so when we talk about how much time fre curnly investing and playing games
the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution ah which is an extraordinary thing but it's also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games were actually changing
what we are capable of as human beings were it evolving to be a more collavorative and hearty species this is true i believeist so consider this really interesting startistic
i was recently published by recetorac carnigi melin university the average young person to day in a country with a strong gamer culture
will have spent ten thousand hours playing on line games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all
for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grate to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as heu're learning about everything else in school
an some of you have probably read malcham gladwell's new book outlires so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hours theory of success its based on this great coginof sciences research that if we can master
ten thousand hours of effort full study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuo sos at it we'll be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world am and so
now what were looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtueoso gamers so the big question is
what exactly our gamers getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
this is how many people we hnow have in the world who spend at least an hour day playing on line games these are our virtuose of gamers five hundred million people who are extrardinarly good at something
and in the next decade we'regan to have another billion gamers who are extrerarlly good
at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consels that are low energy and that work with the wireless fome net works instead of a broad band innernet so that gam is all over the world particularly an india
china brizille can get on line they expect one billion more gamers in the next decadeso bing us up to one point five billion gamers
so i've started to think about what these games are making us virtuous as at here the four things i came up with
the first is urgent optimism can yu think of this is extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle in obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
gamers always believe that an epicine is possible andtha is always worth trying and trying now gamers don't sit around
ca gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they beaten us badly
the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with some one we trust that they will spend their time with us thathey will play by the same rules value the same gole they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trusts and cooperation am and and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result
blissful productivity i love it nor teres a reason why the average world of woarcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game they were actually happier working hard then we are
relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optamized as human beings to do hard meaning ful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if the're given the right work finally epic meaning
gamors love to be attached to all inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective am so you all know wicky petia
biggest wicky in the world second biggest wicky in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of worcraft wicky
five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the inner net than any other topic covered on any other wickyin the world they are building an epic story they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft o caseo these are four super powers that ad up
to one thing gamers are super impowered hopeful individuals
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that's the problem that i am trying to salv
ah there s an econmis in edward castronova whose work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in awnline worlds
and he says we're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exidis to virtual wirls and anline game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says
tat like me emma game doeshine ar unexuberant but he says he says
that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in all mine world than they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better fee back and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says
for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world now
i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to starp making the real world warlk more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened
twenty five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep snuckles right before we had asom game controllers we had sheep snuckles and a these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings
an if your familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian heroditus you might know this history ah which is the history of who invented games and why
herodato says that games particular dice games were invented in the kingdom of lidia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine
that the king of litia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution
so according to roditis they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy
on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and the would be so emerced in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and amerce us in such satisfying blissful prodactivity
they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day theywould play games and on the next day they would eat and according to heroditis
they passed eighteen years this way surviving through a famine by eating on monday and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how are yusing games to day
we're using games to escape real world's suffering we're using games to get away from everything that 's broken in the real environment everything that's not satisfying about real life
and we're getting what we need from games but it doesn't have to end there this is really exciting according to heroditus after eighteen years the famine was in' getting better so the king decided they would play one final thicegame
they divided the entire kingdom and half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go
on an epic adventure they would leave lidia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people
to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive now this sounds a crazy right
but recently diane evidence has shown that the atruskins who then led to the roman empire actually share the same diane as a ancient lydiants and so
reacently scientists have suggested that heroditus's crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might hav actually
saved their culture by playing games escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually saved the entire civilization that way o et we can do that
we have been playing warcraft since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time shrategy game from the world o wor half series that was sixteen years ago
they play dyesgames for eighteen years we've been playing workhalf for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now
they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so that's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of gameplay
from let's get half of us too agree to spend an hour day playing games until we sov reail world problems now know you are asking
how are we in th sal ruo problems and games well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future
we hav this banner in our offices and paloalto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict to the future but we want to to is make the future
we want to imagine the best case anarrio outcome an then we want it impower people to make that outcome a reality we want to imagine epic winds and then give people the means to achieve the epic win
i'am just gon to very briefly show you three games that i 've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epiquins in their own futures
so this is wirled without oil we made this game in two thousand seven this is an awnline game in which you try to survive an oil's shortage
the oil shordage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil so when you come to the game
you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news vitios datd o feeds that show you exactly how much oil coss what's not available how food supplies being affected how transportations being affected a if schools are closhed if there's riding and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blocg about it
to post vidios to post photoes we've piloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand seven and we've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transform itof experience nobody wants to change how they live just because
it's good for the world or because resposed to but if you immersem in an epic adventure and tell them
weve run out of oil this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits they learn in the scame
so for the next whirld saving game we decided to am higher bigger problem than just peak oil ah we did a game called superstoc at the institute for the future
and the premise was a super computor has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet the suprecomputor was called the global extinction aware anes system of course nwe askd people to come on line almost like a jerry bruckhamer moovy
ou know jerry buckhime removies you form a dream team you've got the ashrnot the scientist the ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world
but in our game insad of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody's on the dream team and it's yur job
to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net
we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks that came up with five hundred in sainly creadive solutions that you can go on line if you gougl superstuctancy
so finally the last game were launching at march third this is a game done with the wirl bank institute if you complete the game you will be
curtified by the worl bank institute as a social enevator class of two thousand ten working with universities all over subsehare in africa and we are inviting them to learn social enevation skills we've got a graffic novel
we've got leveling up in skills like local incight knowledge networking sustain ability vision and resourcefulness i would like to nbite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing airias who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
som gen a wrap up now i when to ask a question what do you think happens next we've got all these amazing gamers we've got these games that arekind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved the real world yet
well i hope that you will agree with me that gamors are a human resource that we can use
to do real world work that games are powerful platform for change we have all these amazing super powers blissful productivity the ability to weave a tight social faboric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for ephic meaning i really hope that we can come together
to play games at matter to survive on this planet for another century and that's my hope that youwill join me in making and playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure
that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so i say let the world changing games begin thank you
ef preten right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tetish machine and it's a time machine in everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you can not stay where you are
and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i dontkno the on to go back before there were autimobeles or twitter or american idle
i don' know i'm i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nastaga to wish ful thinking and i understand that i'm that part of that crowd i have to say
idon wan to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i wan to go forward
this is the greatest time there 's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth
mobility opportunity declining raites of disease there's never been a time like this my great grand parents
died all of them by the time they were sixty my grand parents pushed that number to seventy my parents are closing an anady so a
ther'd better be a ther'e better be a nine in the beginning of my death number ah but it's natit in about people like us because
this is a bigger deal than that a kit borne in new delly to day can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago
y to think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true
small pocks fmapox killed billions of people on this planat it reshaped the demography of the globe and a way that no war ever has it's gone
it's vanished we' vanquished it poof in the rich world
diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly dipthuria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are
that seems modern medichine aure ability to feed billians of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out
seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news
unfortunately that's all the good nens because there some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that
despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world
every day back numbers rising and it's rising eally rapidly and its disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination
to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arrable land rain forests oil gaspthey're going away
and they're going away soon and unless we inevate our way out of this mass we're going away too
so the question is can we do that and i i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food there will feed millions of people without wraping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it
i really do believe that and no it ain't wish for thinking but here is the thing that keeps me up ad night one of the things that keeps me up at night
we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can to day we're on the verge of amazing amazing avents in many fields
and yet i actually think we'd oght to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on more french
than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefe and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them fruit and listen
every one's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know a yu're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out
about a decate ago i wrote a story about bhat scenes for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effect of public halthe measure in human history
i'dnno what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on an am soon after that
i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so
i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franken fouids why they thought mooving lawlakiles around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trest passing on nature's ground
but you know i do wat i do i wrote the story i move don i mean on a journalist
we tit we fil we go to dinner it's fun
but these stories bother meand i couldn't figure out why an eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people
they were exactly like the people in this room
and ait just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world
where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quots around it progress
o kay there are reasons for that and i think we know with those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there thathere'is no reason we should of you can just say a few names and people wil understand
turnoble bopaul the challenger
vyachs weapons of mass destruction hanging chads
i mean you know you can choose your list
there are questions and problems whath the people we used to believe were always right so be skeptacal
ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof
you need to accept the proof and we're not thut good at doing that
and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an apademic of fear like one that i've never seen in hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story
that linked the epodemic of autism to the measles months and rebella vaxinshot
very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tongus of staudies should have beendone its an asserious issue
the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweeden from canada andit was all the same no correlation no connection none at all
doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe annecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what
the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because heres a fact
the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaxcine rate for musels is going down
that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible
and what kind of what kind of a thing happened thet we could do that now
i understand it i do understand it because vuthe any one have musels here tos one person in this audience ever see some one dye of musls
doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at al but it happened a hundred ad sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lott od death of measls twenty an hour
but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jennema carthy
can go around preaching messages of fear and aliteracy from platforms like opra and larry king live
and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but there almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon
thi sky was a hero johnas saw he took one of the worst skurges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio pofgone
nok i in the middle not so much his name is paul olfed
he just developed a roade of piras raxin with a bunch of other people it i'll save the lives of four hundred fivehundred thousand
kids in the developing world every year pretty good right wel it's good except ther pall dos arount talking about back scenes and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the wining and e atually says it that way so posi terrorist
when pa speaks in at public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school
and why because paw made a vack scene i knon't need to say this but vaxins are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have musles in this country now
and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids aregin a die agun because it's just a numbers gane andthen ot just gin a die of meesles what about polio let's have that
why not a college class made of mine wrotely a couple weeks ago and said yu know she thought it was a little strid ent nones ever so that before am
she wasn't gin to vacimade her kit against polio no way fine
why because we don't have polio an you know ut we didn't have polio in this country yesterday to day adono may be a go got on a plaine in lagos this morning and he's flying to eleax ritenowis over ohio
and he's gen a land in a couple hours agon a rena car and he's goin to come to longbeach and he's goin to tend one of these thabulus ted dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralitic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on
don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves and lives we love to do it everyone take their vidaments this morning
akcan m shall little i com macar little anty accident to get yo'r going
i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take all turden of medicines and it doesn't matter how often west
find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your yearn they almost never do more than that
i so cat you at to pai twenty eight million dollars for dark year and i'm totally with you
dark yourein dark
why do we do that why do we do that lithik i understand we hate big farmer we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks
it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold
and sol deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms o big plasibo
that's fan tasto i loved big cor fudo
but you know it's not it's it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and i have all sorts of little propsier
none of the dinco srad
echonasia frod a cy i dont even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's froad
and you know at when i say the stuff people screamed at me and they say wouldn't care let people do what they want to do it's its it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because
i don't care if it's the secretor of atrad joss
who saying whom i'm not goin to take the evidence of my experts ong the mamograms or some canser quack who wants to treat his patient
with coffeeunemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence and science you went up in a place you don't want to be
you end up in tabo ind becky south africa he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting
that beat rout garlic and lemin ol were much more effective than the antyretroviral jugs we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of needless deths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease
please don't tell me thereare no consequences to these things there are there always are now
the mot mineless apodomic were in the middle of righnow as this absurd battle between
proponents of gennetically engineered food and the organic aleth it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metiphores
it's idiologi's not sience
every single thing we eat every grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brustle sprop has been modified by man yon are ther work tanjerins in the garden of eden
there wasn't any cannelope
there were christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years
and some of it worked and some of it didn't we got rid of the stuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and ther risks
absolutely but we can put something like vitam an a into rice and that stoff can help millions of people millions of people prolonge their lodge
you dont want to do that i have to say i don't understand it om we object to gunetically engineered food why do we do that whil the things i constantly here are
too many chamicales pastacides hoarmones
minarculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing it's ron
we don't want company's patening life we don't want company's owning seeds and you knowi my response to all that is yes
you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science
this has nothing to do with science its law its morality it's patn stuff ou kno science isn't a company it's not a country
it's not even an ideal it's a process
it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesns but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid
is really very deadening ind its preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next
fifty years weregin to have to grow seventy per cent more food than we do right now seventy per cent this is investment in africa over last thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why
tenetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rottin stuff like cosava for instance cosavas something that halthabillion people leat it's kin like a potato it's just a bunch of callaries it's suks
it doesn't have newtrians it doesn't have proaching tan sciencists or engineering all of that into it right now
and then people would be able to eat en and they be able to not go blind ifthey wouldn't starve and you know what thatwuld be nice  wouldn't be shape paenice but it would be nice
and all i can say about this is
why are we fighting it why  let's ask ourselfs why r we funny it because we don't want to move geanes or othisus about moving juns around it's not about camicales
it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormomens our insistents on having biggor food better food singular food
this isn't about rice chrispies thir's about keeping people alive and it's about time we' started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't
if we continued to act the way we're acting we're guilty of something that i don't think we want to be guilty of high tatironialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish
it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it
so after this amazingly fund conversation
it might want a saty so you wase soin agann this ridiculous time machine and go forward
an absolutely absolutely i do it's struck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on any thing we want we can move it where we want o move it
and we're gun to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead
we're ain to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as i'm concerned
that's something the world needs right now o
a di
de
one day losanjelis times call mis stivlopas was walking along the streets of down town lasanjelus when he heard
beautiful music and the source was a man
an african american man charming rugged homeless playing a violend that only had two strings
i 'm telling a story that many of you know because steev's columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a moovy
with robert downiy junior acting a stivholopas and jamie fox says nethanel anthony ars the juliard traine double basis whose promising career was cut short
by a tragic affliction with paranide skitzophrenia
nethanel dropped out of juliard he suffered a complete break down and thirty years later he was living homeless on the streets of skidro in donton lasantelis i encourage all of you to read steave's book or to watch the movy to understand not only the beautiful bond
that form between these two men but how music helpd shaped that bond and ultimately was instrumental if you'll pardon the pund in helping the thaniel get off the streets
i meat mister ars in two thousand eight two years ago at waldisny concert hall he had just heard of performance of batoven's first and fourth symphanies and came back stage and introduced himself when speaking in a very joviald and gregarious way about yoyoma and hillery clenton and how the dodgers were never gon to make the world series all because of the treacherous first violent passage work in the last movement of batoven's fourth symphony
and we got talking about music and i got an emale from steve a few days later saying that nethanal was interested in a violin lesson with me now i should mention that nethanel refuses treatment
because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorozin and handcufs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
but as a result now he is prone to these skitzophrenic appesodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding
and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skid row exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
and nethaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at waltesny concerthal he had a kind of mannic glint in his eyes he was lost
and he was talking about invisible deemons and smoke and how some one was poisoning him in his sleep and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraidthat i was ton toluse him that he was going to sink into one of his states
and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpegyo is ind other exciting forms of didactic violin petigoti
so i just started playing
and i played the first movement of the bato in vylincan churtel and as i played i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nethaniel's eyes
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible farma suiticle a chemical reaction for which my playing the music
was its cattlist and the phaniel's manic rage
was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity an engrace
and in a miracle he lifted his own violen and he started playing by ear certain snippits of violent concertos which he then askd me to complete mendleson chicovski sibelyos
an we started talking about music from bath to basoven and broms brook near the all the bees from battok all the way up to esopecasalenan and i understoodthat he not only had an incychlapietic knowledge of music
but he related to this music at a personal level he spoke about it with a kind of passion and understanding that i share with my coleigues in the losangulistphilimonic
and through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed
from the paronoid disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downta masangelis to the charming
eir youdyat brilliant juliartraine musician music is medicine
music changes us and for nethanial music issanity because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality
and that is an escape from his tormented state
and i understoo that this was the very escence of art this was the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental cor our emotions
and through our artistic lens through our creativity we're able to shape those emotions into reality
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us inspires and unites us
and for nethaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him
and i will always make music with nethaniel whether we ar at waltd isine concerthall or on skidrow because he reminds me why i became a musician thank you
lllllllllllllll
hever gopdo
and wn a place so tin that i shamelessly stol from cheallos so pleased forgive m
several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced a designe challenge called the marshmellow challenge and the ideas pretty simple teams of for have to build a tallest freestanding structure out of twenty sticks of spegetty one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmellow the marshmella has to be on top and though it seems really simple it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorperate it into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then i've
conducted about seventy designe workshops across the world with students and designers ind architects even the setios of the fortune fifty and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i like to share some of them with you so
normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figar out what is gonto look like they jocky for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketching they lay out sfigetti ah they'd spend themajority of their time assembling the sticks into evergrowing structures and then
finally just as they're running out of time some one takes out the marsh mellow and then they ginjerly put it on top and they stand back
and cut o
they admire their work but what really happens most of the time is that the dtada turns into an oh because the weight of the marshmellow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so
there are number of people whod have a lot more o moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
they lie that a cheep they i get distracted they've and they produced really lamed structures and of course there is theams that have a lot more tada structures and among the best are recent graduates of kinder garden
and
it's pretty maysing as peter tells us ow not only do do they produce the tallest structures but ththe most interesting structures of them all so the question you won't ask is how come
why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of hus none of the kids spend any time trying to be s iov spegatty ink
right they don't tie it spend time jocking for par but ther's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan
right and then they execute on it andthen what happens as when they put the marshmello on  top they run out of time and what happens it's a crisis
found familiar right roke wut kinder gardeners do differently is that they start with the marsh mellow and they build prototype successive protetypes
always keeping the marthnello and top so they have multipal times ad to to fix inte bild protetypes along the way so hesziners recognized this type of calaboration
as the essence of the iterative process and with each versin kids get instant fee back about what works and what does n't work
so the capacity to play in protetype is is really essential but let's look at how different teams perform
so the average for most people is around twenty inches business school students about to half of that lawyers a lttle better but not much better than that kindergardens better than most adelts who does the very best
architects and engineers thankfully an
thirty nine inches of the tallest structure a i've seen and why is it because they understand trangles and self reenforcing geometrical patterns or the key to building self a reenforce o the se stable structures
so i se ios little bit better than average but here's were gets interesting if you put in a executive admen on the team they get significantly better
credible yu now
ou look around you go out that teams gono in e doth tal beforehand and why is that because they have special skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays a close attention to to work
ah will significantly imimprove the team's performance special ite skilles and facilitation skilles at the combination leads to to strong success
you have ten teams atipically performed you'l get may by six or so that i've standing structures and ai i tried something interesting i thought let's
up the anti once so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of soft war to the winning team so what do you think happened tothese designed students what was the result
here's would happen there r
not one team had a standing structure not one had a a if anyone had bilt say a a one instructure they doidn takeen om the the prize so isn't an interesting that high stakes a have a strong impact we did the exercise again with the same students what d you think happened then so now the understand the value of prodetyping
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produce the tallest structures in the least amount a time so there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
so you might ask why would any one actually spend time ruenning a marshanello a challenge and the reason is i cto help creat viginal tools and processes to help pa teams build cars and vidio games and visual effects a
and what the marshmellow challenge dozes that helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly
every project has its own marshmellow des net that the challenge provides a shered experience a commn language a common stance to build the right protetype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you hare interested may wender go to marshamello challenge dodcommange a blog that you can look at how to build a the marshmellows ar step by stepp instructions on this a there are
crazy examples from around te world of how people tweak and adjust the system there's world records that are on this as well
and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport ah it demands that we bring all of our senses to the tast and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have a at hand and sometimes a little protetype of theis experience is all that it takes to turn us from a and o moment to a tadam oment and that can make a big difference thank you very much
