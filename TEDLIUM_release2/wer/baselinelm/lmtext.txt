i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my cesar's handy whenever am writing anything but
i had already finished editing the peace and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
disabled ajitive crippled helpless useless rect
stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
run down worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handy cape
senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
see also hurt useless and weak antinems healthy strong capable
i was reading this lets out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i had just gotten past mangled
when my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
ah an an impact that the assault from these words unleashed
no i'm of course this is my raggedy old the sarras i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact a printed was the early nineteen eighties
when i would have been a starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids in the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using it the sores back then
i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived some one like me to have nothing positive what soever going for them when in fact to day
i am celebrated for ah the opportunities and adventures my life have procured so am i immediately
went to look up the two thousand nine on line addition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the up dated version of this entry
unfortunately it's not much better i find thee the last two words under near antinums particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
so it's not just about the words
it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's impowered
by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
we might be pudding lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
once at a person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pease tilla
ah no an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
always wore really colorful bow ties and i had the very perfect disposition to work with children
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical far recessions
i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands of different colors you know
to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
you know i was already bargaining at a fiber old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing his exercises unsuccessfully of course
and one day he came in to my session am exhaustive and unforgiving
the sessions and he said to me wal ami you are such a strong powerful little girl
i think you're on to break one of those bands when you do break it i won to give you a hundred box now course this was a simple ploy
on doctor pa's part to get me to do the exercise as i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest fier old in the second floor ward
but what he affectedly did for me was reshaped an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
and i have to wonder to day to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
but in the previous instances of those the saracentry yet our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
nor the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which had been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
my legs ah no lazar surgery for vision imperament a titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engaged with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature is imposed on them
not to mention social net working platforms allows people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go a line with global groups of their own choosing
thou perhaps acknowledg is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that every one has something rare and powerful to offer our society
and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset a human ability to adapt is an interesting thing because people
have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
and i'm an make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side step or circumnavigate the presume pitfalls of a life with prophetic or what other people perceive is my disability
but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and ominous suggest that this is a good thing
adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i feel lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
certainly i'm not trying to diminish but impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not your into met adversity but how you're going to meet it
so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
and we do a service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
there is an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputi and the subjective social opinion of whether or not i am disabled
and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their lives we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
disable somebody perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
we are effectively grading some one's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
and most importantly there is a partnership between those perceived efficiencies and our greatest creative ability
so it's not about de valuing or negating mes more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
racked in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
embracing it grappling with it they's a wrestling term may be even dancing with it
and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful were less burdened by the presence of it
this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwin and it was a hundred fifty years ago when writing about evolution the darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don know we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity and something more than just tough times
maybe we can see it is change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves too yet
i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
and who's normal there is no normal there's common there's typical
there is no normal and would you want to meet that poor base person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradise from one of
achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency do we even a t it more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
they are rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologist tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
there is evidence that neanderthal sixty thousand years ago carried they are elderly and those with serious physical injury
and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
a few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up and that red zone and north eastern pennsylvania
and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had short on i heard this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't am in mullins
i turn around and is his older man i have no idea who is and i said ah i'm sorry sir i don't
have we met i i don't remember meeting you you say will you wouldnt remember meeting me we when we met i was delivering you from your mother's woom
so the oh that guy is no mo and of course actually
it did click this man was doctor ken a man that i had only known about throu my mother's stories of that day because of course
typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks and so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
and because i was born without the sable bones and had feet turned in and a few toes on his foot in a futosan that he had to be the bearer the stranger
had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
and you would never have the kind of nobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you been makin a liar at a me ever since
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
whether winning as second grade spelling be marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween prad winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
and he was using it in integrating it into teaching a resident students med students from hanuman
a medical school and herse medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor he was the potential of the human will
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be in that as a determinate in the quality of some one's life
and doctor king went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
and even if given a matamo modicum of support is left to their own devices a child will achieve
to doctor kane made that shift and thinking he understood that the is a difference between the medical condition and what some one might do with it
there's been a shift in my thinking over time and that if you had asked me at fifteen years old if i would have trayed it prophetic for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then did you ask me to day i'm not so sure
and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
to all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and your off if you can hand somebody the key
to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for some one at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
you're teaching them to open doors for themselves exact the exact meaning of the word educate
comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
there is a case study done in nineteen sixty breaden when they were moving from compra grammar schools to comprehensive schools called the streaming trials we call it tracking
here in the states its separating students from b c d and so on
and yo know the students get the topper cricklem the best teachers et cetera while they took over a three month period de level students gave the maze told them they were as told them they were bright and at the end of this three months period
they were performing at a level and of course the heart breaking flip side of the study is that they took the students
and told him they were dees and that's what happened at the end of that three months period those who were still around at school besides the drop people had dropped out
this is the crucial part of of this castudy was that the teachers were duped too
the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the asians these are the deestudnts and that's how they went about teaching them
and treating them though i think
hath the only true disability
is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity in our innate ability to imagine
if instead we can boaster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hapi
and my friend jock amos told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
how can i talk to day about energy and climate
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaxins and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest tubillion live better lives
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to any one else on the planet
the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow he'll be too much rain not enough rain
things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them
also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price ob to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time
a really advanced civilization as based on a advances and in energy the cold revolution fueled
the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make a modern materials and do so many things
and so were in a wonderful situation with a electricity in the rich world
but as we make a cheaper and let's say let's go for making it a twices cheap we need to meet a new constraint
and that constraint has to do with so too so too is warming the planet
and the occasion on so too is actually a very straight forward one if you sum up the so too that gets admitted
that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather
perhaps worse the indirect effects in that of the natural legal systems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get echo system collapses
now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase in of so to
to what temperature will be and wear the positive febacks art there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
i asked the top scientists and as several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just and i'll cut in half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero
the temperature will continue to rise and so that's that's a big challenge it's very different then saying in a word twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can do a sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero
now we put out a lot of carben dioxide every year all over twenty six billion tons offer each american
it's about twenty tons ah for people in poor countries it's less than one ton an average about five tons for every one on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that we'll bring that down to zero
it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flatened it at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this occasion as for factors
a little bit of multiplication so you got a thing on the left so too that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people
the services each person choosing on average the energy on average preach service and the so to being put out
a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this tout into zero a probably one of these numbers is gen i have to get pretty near to zero
ah that's back from a high school age rub let's let's take a look ah first we've got population
now the world to day has six point eight million people that's heated up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new back scenes health care
reproductive held services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen per cent but there we see an increase of about one point three
the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we
clothing t v a heading these are very good things a getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost every one on the planet and it's a great thing
o for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use lass but every year
this number on average is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person
here we have a very basic service do you have light in in your house to be able to read your home mark and in fact these kids don't there going out and reading their school work under the street lamps
now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting
a through a different types of cars a different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially
some individual services even bring it down by ninety per cent there are other services like how we make for lizer how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
and so over all here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex
but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billions to it best maybe thirteen million tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's goin to be a key one
and this is the amount of so to put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero ah if you burn coal
no if you burn at gaston almost every way we may electricity to day a except for the emerging renobles and new clear puts out zio too and so we're going to have to do it a global scale
is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i is the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible
the mice processer is a miracle the personal computers a miracle of the inner netat services are a miracle so the people here participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a dead line
here we have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actual have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight time line
now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that
it really got them involved in the idea ah you know other people who live in the squitos so with energy i like to come up with is this ah i decided that releasing fireflies
would be my contribution to the environment here this here so here we have a somnauteply flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar a
now there's all sorts of gimmick solutions like that one ah but they don't really ad up too much we need solutions either one or several that have
unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions or people seeking i really only see five that
can achieve the big numbers i've left out tied thermal fusion maples those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here
is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them ah because they they look daunting because they all
have significant challenges ill let's look first at the burning post fuels either a burning coal or burning natal gas what you mean to do there
seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the so too after you've burnt it going out the flue pres rise it cradle liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
now we have some pilot things that do this that the sixteen eighty per cent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on were these so to quantities should be put
i'll be hard but the tops one here is this long tremisue who's goin to be sure who's going to guarantee
a something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of new clear other things this is a lot a volume
so that's a top one next and de nuclear it also has three big problems clost particle highly regulated countries as high
the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that he did not you have these human operators that the fuel
doesn't get used for weapons and then where it what do you do with the waste although it's not very large there a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very top problems that might be a solvable and so should be worked on
the last three of the five i've grouped together ah these are what people often referred to as the renewable sources and they actually
although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density
energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming
ser talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than than you think of is a normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources the sun doesn't shine
all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so you depend on these sources
you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here
ah we have transmission challenges for example save this energy sources outside your country ah you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem
and to mantilize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that yet made for cars for computers for forms for flash lights for everything and compared that
to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes
of all the energy and so in fact we need a big break through here something that's going to be
a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the interment source to be above say twenty to thirty per cent
of what you're using if you're counting on it for a hundred per cent you need a an incredible miracle battery
now how are going to go forward on this what's what's the right approach is it a man hanan project what's the the thing that can get us there what we needs wants
of companies a working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least a hundred people and a lot of em you look at and say they're crazy that's good
and i think here in the tea group we have many people a who are already pursuing this ah
bill gros has several companies in cleon called a solar that has some great solar thermal technology a van old cosas investing and dozens of companies ah that are doing great things and have a interesting possibilities and i'm i'm trying to help back that a natheribl than i actually are backing a company
that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the new clear approach of there are some innovations in new clear mogar liquid
ah an innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around ah is not all that surprising the idea of a terror power
is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one per cent of just you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine per cent
the two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people had talked about it for a long time
but they could never stimulate properly whether it would work or not and so it through the advent of modern super computers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right
materials approach ah this looks like it would work and because your burning that ninety nine per cent ah you have
a greatly improved cost a profile you actually burn up the waste and you can act use as fuel all the left over waste from to day's reactors and so instead of warning about them you just take that it's a great thing
it breeds this uranium as it goes along so kindly like a candle and sees its a log there often referred to as a travelling ware actor in terms a fuel
now this really solves the problem i've got a picture here of a place in contaki this is the left over the ninety nine per cent where they've taken out the part they bore now so called to pleaded uranium that would power the you ask
for hundreds of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process you have enough fuel for the entire life time of the rest of the planet so
you know it's got lots lots of challenge as i had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card i'll look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and and then i'll look at the intermediate for twenty fifty you've heard many people talk about
this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty per cent will be used up by
things going on in poor countries still some agriculture a hoply we will have cleaned up a forest resimant a so to get to that eighty per cent the developed countries
including countries like china will have had a switch their electra electricity generation all together ah so the other great is are we deploying
this zero mission technology have we deployed it in all the developed countries and were in the process of getting it out elsewhere that superimportant
it's a key element of making that report card so backing up from there let you the twenty twenty report card look like
well it again i should have the two elements and we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the last we admit the last that sum will be of so too and therefore the last the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there
doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or may be even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation
on these break through these break through we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed
there's a lot of great books that men written about this the algar book our choice and the david mackay book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think in great of a frame work that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this
there's a lot the house to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that
we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifth years i can pick whose president i can pick of acne
which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with nose to gets invented
this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish the division between the people who think short term long term will be terrible
between you is in china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lives of those two billions will be far worse so what do we have to do what am my appealing a tu de a step forward and
and drive we needed to go for war research funding and when countries get together at places like copenhagen the sun
just is cast these too they should discuss this innovation of jena and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low level suspending
on these inivative approaches we need do need the market in senates seotutaxs capon trade something that gets that price signal out there
we need to get the message out we need have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you
thank you thank you
thank you ah sit to understand more about about a terapala right a
we fessor can give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is
but to the actually do this soft where by the super computer higher all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out
ah in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions the toting is building the pilot reactor
a finding the saver billion a finding the the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these one should get the first one built
if it works as advertised then it's as clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than new clear as we know it
and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like like a vertical kind of colum of nuclear fuel of this sort of spanoraniam and then and then and then the precise starts at the top and kind of works down
that's right to day you're always refueling the reactorsy of lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing we are opening it up and moving things in and out that's
that's not good so if you han't berry very cheap fuel then you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log
put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixth years ah and and then it's done
it is a nuclear parpon that is its own wise disposal solution
ye wud hammonds with the waist you can you can let it sit there ah there's a lot less waste under this approach ah then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that
and and we start out acted by taking the waste that exists to day that sitting in these cooling pools or dry casting by reactors that's our ful
to begin with so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours and you're reducing the volume of the waist quite dramatically as you're going through this process
you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where where is their most interest in actually doing something with this
well we haven't picked a particular place but ah and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about ending that's called nuclear
so we we've got a lot of interest ah the people from the company have been in russia india china i've been back seeing the secretary energy her talking about how this
ah fits in to the the energeogenda so optimistic ah into the prancin japanese of don semorg this is a variant on something that has been done it's an important
advance but it's like a fast racer in a lot of comp countries to built them so anybody use donafastractor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built
so in in your mind a time scale and likelihood are actually taking certain light their live
what we need for one of these
my scale or electric electrical generation things that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that sort of the dead line
that the environ models environmental models of have have shown us that we have to meet and in other power if things go well
a which is wishing for lot could easily meet that and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need be hundreds
who likewise if their science goes well if the funny for their pliant pilot plants goes well that they they can compete for this and it's best if multiple succeed because then you to use a mix a mix these things we certainly need one to succeed
atoms of big scale or possible game changes this is the biggest that you are aware of out that
an energy break through is the the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental come spring but the environment comes frate just makes that so much
so much greater in the new clear space there are other enevators ah no we don't know there were as well as we know this one but
the mogeler people now that's a different approach there's a liquid typryactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say about us
and so there there are different ones but the the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of say coal
and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the foot print in cost the potential in terms of effect on land and varies things is in almost any class of its own
if this doesn't wo
then what do we have to stop taking imugincy measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable
yet if you get into that situation it's like
if you are
you've been over eating and you're about to have a heart attack and then then then where do you go you may need heart surge something there is a line of research on what's called jean genera
which are various technics that would delay the heading to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together
now you hope that's just an entrance palsy you hope you don't need to do that some people say you should even work on the entrance palsy because it might make you
lazy that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery i'll be there to save you i'm not sure that's wise given the importance of the problem but
ah there now that the gioigineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect
climate skeptics if you had em a sentence or two to say to them how how might you persuade them that they are wrong
well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few
are they saying that there's negative feedback effects have to do with clouds that off sat things they're very very few things that they can even say and there's a chance and a million of those things the main prim you have here
it's kind like aids you make a mistake now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now
that how to do it again later in a somewhat uncertain a painting in fact the apes see report you no that
that's not necessarily the worse case and there are people in the vitriol to look at ipse and say okay you know that that isn't that big of veal the fact is it's that uncertain part
that should move us towards us but my dream here is that if you can make it economic anne meet the scioto constraint then the skeptic say o ka
i don't care that it doesn't put out see to i kind o wish it did put out se tu but i guess i'll except it caused cheaper
that out right what's come before
o
and so that would be your response to the the the bin lamborg argument that basil if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve the seer too problem is can to take away all your other gals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria sir for this is it is it is a stupid waste of the births resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do
yet the actual spending on the arndpiece you don't say to you i should spend ten billiar more than it is right now it's not that dramatic it shouldn't take away from other things the thing you get into big money on
and this reasonable people can disgrace when you have some sonic atomic and you're trying to fund that that to me mostly is a waste unless you're very close in you're just funny in the learning curbing it's goin to get very cheap i believe we should try in a more
ah things that have a potential to be far less expensive if the train off he get into his let's make energy superindsuper
a expensive then the rich can afford that mean all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our life style
the disaster is for that to billion and even lanborg has changed a his stick now is wise the ard
ah getting more disgust he he's still because of his earlier stoff sort of associate with the sceptic camp but he's realized that's that's a pretty lonely camp and and so
ah he's making the aran de point and and so there is a thread of something that i think is appropriate the arian de piece it's crazy how little it's fundo
well bill i suspect i i speak a bar of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much
an give
so i've known a lot of fish in my life
i've loved only too
at first one was that
it was more like a passionate affair
it was a beautiful fish
flavor ful textured
made a bat caller on the menu what a fish
even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustain ability
speak if ye'll go about selling it in
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months
one day the head of the company called and asked if i'd speak out an event
about the farms sustain ability absolutely i said
here's a company trying to solve
what's become this unimaginable problem for a ship's
how do we keep fish on our menus
for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas
like we clear cut forest
it's hard to over straight the destruction
ninety per cent a large fish the ones we love the tune is the halobets the sammons swordfish the cleft talmas nothing left
so for better for worse agriculture fish farming see part of our future
a lot of arguments against it
fish farms ballo
most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna the major draw back
s got a feed conversion ratio a fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tone
not very sustainable none takes very good either
so here finally
was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support him
the day before the event i called they had a pier for the company
what's call him don
down is a just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for from farming so far out to sea you you don't pollute that's right he said we're so far out
the waste from our fish gets distributed
not concentrated and then he added
were basically a world unto ourselves
a fee conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business
two point five on grate the two on five wet what would feed sustain am proteins he said
great i said got off upon
and that night i was lying in bed i thought
what the hell is a sustainable approaching
so the next day just before the event i called down i sat down what are some examples of sustainable proteins said he didn't know
they would ask around while i got on the fall of a few people on the company no one could give me a straight answer
until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist
let's call him down to
i'm done i said what are some examples of sustainable prosings
when he mentions some ages
and some fish meals and then he said chicken poets
as a chicken pots he said father's skin
bone meal scraps dried and crosses them defeat
said what percentage
of your feet is chicken
thinking in a two per cent
it's about thirty per cent he said
in don
what's the stayin a bull about feeding chicken to fish
there is a long paws on the line
and he said there's just too much chicken in the world
i fell out of love with this fish
not because i'm some self righteous goody shoe shoes footy
actually am
and i fell out of love with this fish because i sware i got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken
this second fish
but it's a different kind of love story
it's the romantic kind
the kind were the more you get to know your fish you'll love the fish
i first aid it at a restaurant in southern spain
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time
she canna set us up
it came to the table a bright
almost shimmering white color
the chef had over cooked it like twice over okaamazingly it was still delicious
who can make a fish taste good
after it's been over cooked
i can't but this guy can't
let's call him me gale actually his name is meale
i know he didn't cook the fish and he's not a shaft at least in the way that you and i understand it
he's a biologist
at vetalapamma it's a fish farm in the south western corner of spain
it's at the tip of the guadalquivir river
until the nineteen eighty the farm was in the hands of the argentina
they raise beef cattle amalwas essentially wet lance
they did it by draining land they built this intricate series of canals
and they pushed water off the land and out into the river
while they couldn't make it work not economically
and ecologically it was a disaster
killed like ninety per cent of the birds which for this place in the lottobirds
and so in nineteen eighty two
a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do
they were verse the flow of water they literally flipped the switch
set a pushing water out
they used the channels to pull water back in they fluttered the canals
they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish for
bat mole shrimp eel
any in the process meal and this company
completely reversed the ecological destruction
the farm's incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this
he stared out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are fluttered canals and this thick rich marsh lam
i was there not long ago with me ye
he's an amazing ye
like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile dundee
a gate
there we are flogging through the wet land
and a panting and sweating at mud up to my knees and me gale is calmly conducting a biology lecture
here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder type
now it's mentioning
the mineral needs the fight o plant them
and here here he sees a grouping patter that reminds him of the tansonan erat
it turns out me gale spent the better part of his career in the macombe national park in africa
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish said fish
might i know anything about fish
i'm an expert in relationships
and then he's off
launching into more talk about rare birds and ages and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinate you know the biatic community unplugged canethan you know scrape
but i was i up and my head
was swooning over that over cooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before so i interrupted i sent me down what makes your fish taste so good
we pointed the algy
i know do the algy the fight o plank then the relationship sits as amazing
right but what your fish eating and what's the feed conversion ratio
we goes on to tell me
it's such a rich system
that the fish are eating what the beating in the wild
the plant by a mask to fight mine the soup lines and it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally self for nein
there is no feed
ever heard of a farm the dozen feet its animals
later that day i was driving round this property with me gain i asked him a self for a place it seemed so natural
unlike any fish for elegant farm i'd ever been at
with how do you measure success
at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos
a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see
that success he said
look at their valleys pink they're feasting
casting as holly confess i said meg aren't they feasting on your fish
yes he said
we lose twenty per can of our fish and fish eggs to birds
i will last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it
more than two hundred fifty different species it's become to day the largest
and one of the most important
private bird sanctuaries in all of europe
i said to me gale isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm
he shook his head no he said
we farmed extensively
not intensively
this is an ecological net work
the flamingoes eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the pita plant an so the pinker the belly the better the system
look at let's review a farm a dozen feet its animals
on a farm that measures its success
on the health of its creditors
a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary
oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place
they bred in a town a hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests
every morning they fly one hundred fifty miles into the farm
and every evening they fly one huron fifty miles back
they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two
no getting
now i was imagining a march of the penguins then you know so i looked at me gall i said
me go do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm
and then do they fly one hundred fifty miles back at night
do they do that for the children
he looked at me like i just quarter a wit me huston saw
he said no they do i as the food's better
no i didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish
which was delicious and i don't like fish skin i don't like it seared i'm like a crispy
is that acrid tar like flavour
i must never cook with it
yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like firkin
i tasted sweet and clean
like you were taking a bite of the ocean
i mentioned that to me alan he nodded he said the skin as like a spunge a last offence before anything enters the body it evolved
to soak up impurities and then he added
but our water has no impurities
oke a farm the dozen feet its fish
a farm the measures of success
by the success of its creditors
and then i realize when he says
a farm that has no impurities he made a big under statement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the gaelic of your river
a river that carries with it all the things the rivers tend to carry these days
chemical contaminate pest aside run off
and when it works its way through the system
and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it enter
the system is so healthy it purifies the water
so not just a farm a dozen feet its animals not just a farm that measures the health
they had success by the health of its creditors
but a farm that's literally all water purification plant
and not just for those fish
but for you and me as wealth because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic
a drop in the ocean i know but i'll take it and so should you
because this love story
however romantic is also instructive
you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food
whether were talking about bats or beef cattle
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good
but for a lot of people
that's a big too radical
we're not realists as pedes
were lovers
we love farmers markets we love small family farms
we talk about local food we'd organic
and when you suggest these are the things that will in shore
the future of good food some one somewhere stands up and says he
halla thank flemings but how you don't feed the world
haunted the world can i be honest i don't love that question
no not because we already produce a not calories to more than feed the world
one billion people
we'll go hungry to day one billion that's more than ever before
because of gross inequalities and distribution not tunis
that i don't love this question because it's the term and the logic of our food system for last fifty years
feed grained arbavors
past the sides to mona cultures chemicals to soil chicken a fish
and all long agra business has simply asked
if for feeling more people more cheaply how terrible could that be
that's been the motivation spend the justification it's bein the business plant
of american agriculture we shall call i what it is
a business in liquidation
a business that's quickly a rotting ecological capital that makes that very production possible
a sort of business and his agriculture
our bread basket is threatened to day not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land
not by pumps but by fresh water
not by chain saws but by forest and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea on to the world
let's start by asking how we one to feed ourselves
or better how can we create conditions that enable every community
to feed itself
to do that don't look
at the agrabusus model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's high on capital chemistry and machines
and it's never produced anything really good to eat
instead let's look to the ecological middle
that's the one that relies on two billion years
of on the job experience
farms that aren't worlds unto themselves
farms that
restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively
farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships
as there the ones
they're experts in flavour too
and if i'm going to be really honest
there are better shaft than i'll ever be
you don't look at it that
because if that's the future of good food it's goin to be delicious thank you
everybody talks about happiness these days
i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years
and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researches there is a lot of happiness couching everybody would like to make people happier
but in spite of all this flood of work there are several cot of traps that would have make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness
and my talk to day will be mostly about these congreve traps thus applies to lay people thinking of their own happiness and at a price to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out where just as me stop as anybody else's
the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity turns out that the word happiness is just not a youthful word any more because we applied to too many different things
i think there is one particular meaning for to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory base cleats between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and are both lump in the notion of happiness
and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that effects well being without distorting its importance and in this is a real comet if trap there is just no way of getting it right
now i'd like to start with an example of somebody u
what a question and answer assertion after one of my lectures
reported a story and that was the story he said he had been listening to a symphony
and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added reading quite emotionally
it ruined the whole experience
but the tartans
when it had ruined where the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep
when this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves ah there is an experiencing self
who lives in the present
and knows the present is capable of re living the past a basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor us does it hurt now when i thought true here
and then there is a remembering self
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score
and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor
approaches in asking the question
how have you been feeling lately or how was your trip to albano something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self
and he and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of a mess about the notion of happiness
now the remembering self
is a story teller and that really starves with a basic
response of our memories starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story
and let me begin with one example
thus as an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure of on going to detail it's no longer pain for these days but it was painful when the six when this study was run in the nineteen nineties
there are the report of their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their their recordings and who are asked
who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question in clearly patient be suffered more its colonoscopy was longer and everym
minute of pain that patient had patient be had and more but now there is another question
how much did these patients think they suffered
and here is a surprise
and the surprises that patient had a much worse memory of the olonoscopy than patient by the stories of the colonosopies were different
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is this thing but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse if the one where pain was let it speak at the very end
it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonosope and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for a than for bee in memory
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering of from the point of view of the experiencing self clearly be had a worse time
now what you could do with patient and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoskopy of patient a by just keeping the tubing without digging it too much that will
that will cause the patient to suffer but dressed a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off
and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have endowed patient
with a better story about his experience
what that finds the story
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up when he finds a story are changers significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominate it
now the experiencing self lives its life
continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straight forward
they are lost for ever me most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know the psychological presents is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know and in a life they are about six hundred millions of them in a month they are about six hundred thousand
most of them don't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self
and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count
that what happens during these moments of experience is our life
it's the finight resource that we are spending while we are on this earth
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us so we have the
remembering self and the experiencing self and they are really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time
from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vocation and the second week is just as good as the first then
the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vocation is barely better
than the one week vacation because they are known new memories added you have not trained the story
and in this way time is actually the critical variable the distinguishes a remembering of from our experiencing so time has very little impart on the story
now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions
because if you have a patient who has had to say to colonosco pies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose then
the one that cruises in the one that has in a the memory that is less bad and that's the truth the surgeon that will be chosen
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future
we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories
and basil you can look at the unio tyranny of the remembering self
and you can think of the remembering of sort of dragging the experiencing self to experiences that experiencing self does need
i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case that is that it's
we we go on vocations to a very large extent in the service of a remembering self
and this is a bit how to dress the fire that area
how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanation that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and
when i think about that i think about a vocation we had an in tactic a few years ago which was clearly the best location of the hat and i think of it ratelly often
relative to how much i think of other vocations and
i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three weeks trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour
now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half
there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in or in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of verse
there is a genuine question
why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a short experiment
imagining that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed
and you'll get an uneasy drug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vocation
and and if and if you would choose a different vocation
there is a conflict between your two cells and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time
then you get one answer and if you think in terms of of memories you might get another answer
why do we bake them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with choice between the two cells
now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one herself
and so you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy of the moments in the experiencing self life
and there are happiness for moments as a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of
getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing that is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life
very different notions any one who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of well being
who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years
and there are no efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization has a world pole with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about
their experiences and there there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells
and the main lesson i think that we have learned in art they are really different
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily their living their life
and vice versa you or just to give your sense of the correlation the correlation is about point five with that means as if you met somebody and you were told or his father is six feet tall
how much would you know about this height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody
rank their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self
so the correlation is low we know something about what control satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important golds are very important we know that happiness is mainly
being satisfied with people that we like
spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures but this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves you are going to end up doing very different things
the bottom line of what i've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion
now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that
we do not attend the sent to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california
you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if if say you live in ohayo a and
and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places
and that contrast says in climate well it turns out the climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that besides how happy people are
but now because the reflective self is in charge
you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to californian the hope of getting happier
well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that
but one thing will happen they will think they are happier
because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio
and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and
i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you
i give that i out to de
thank thank you so much now when we are on the foam a few weeks ago a
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallop serve
is that is it some that you can share since you do have a few moments left now
short ah i think the most interesting resolve that we found in the gallop of his is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found out with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self
when you know we looked at how in our feelings very within come
and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it's the lad representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year
it fifty thousand
sixty thousand
sixty thousand pesos sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they yet progressively unhappy of the poor or vitiate above that we get an absolutely flat line i mean i've really seen lying so flat
clearly what has happened is money does not buy your experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys your misery
and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of this
the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you are the more satisfied you that does not hold for emotion
but done by the un whole american endeavor is about in a life liberty of the pursuit of happiness
if people took seriously that finding a mate it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about
when i might for example taxation policy and so forth is there is there any chance that politicians that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it
you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness rest in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the yoke it is happening and in other countries it is happening
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of public policy
it's going to take a while and it's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life in valuations so we need to have that debate fairly soon how to enhance happiness
goes very different ways depending and how you think on whether you think of the remembering self when you think of the experiencing self this is going to influence policy i think and he is to come in the united states efforts are being made
to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decade o to part of national statistics
while it seems to me that this issue well or at least should be
the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next ears thank you so much for inventing behaviour economics
at alicante
for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is a something face
is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies ah the placebo effect just because the person thinks
that what's happening to them is a farmer cuticle or some sort of a for pain management for example if they believe it enough there's a measurable effect in the body called the posed effect something face becomes something real because of some one's perception of it
ah in order for us to understand each other i want a start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i must show you how it works this a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least nineteen fifties ah i learned myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies
i i'll do it for you and then i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explained it kaeso i here it happens knife which you could examine my hand which you could examine
i can hold the knife and my fists like this i'll get my sleeve back and ought to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here i
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i am squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve and the object of this is quite simple
ah i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well
my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it
and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve he's no trickery and you can examine everything cut
so this a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very even those a very simple trick methoologically probably many of you in the room know this trick at what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand
i say i'm going to grab hold of my risk to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i'm holding on to my wrist is because that's actually the secret
of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger i'd hear my index fingers just can a shift from where it is to a position
finding out like this i
nice word
some one who didn't have a childhood is out there
so it goes like this from here i and as i move around my finger shifts and we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in the way it processes information it doesn't count one two three it groups them but that's not really what this is about right then i open my hand obviously its clinging there not by animal magnetism but by
chicanery my index finger being there and then when i closed my finger the same thing as i moved back
this motion can have covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there's a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors and thanks now
what does that have to do with the proceble effect well
i read a study ah a year or so ago that really blue my mind wide open i am not a doctor or a research or so this to me was an astonishing thing
turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like a aspen shaped just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective
even though neither one of these things has any farmer suitable quits their sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill lilla what
that really flit me out turns out though that that's not even where it stops if you are have capsles
they're more effective than tablets in any form a colored capital that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capitol dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills
i don't remember this to this inane but the point is
these dosages have somethin to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in a placebo you go to the needle
right a syringe with some inner couple see seas of some inert something and you inject this into a patient while this is such a powerful image in their minds that it is so much stronger than the white pill as it really this graff on well i'll show it us some other time when we have slides the point is
the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capital is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real a farmer cuticle quality it's only your belief that makes it real
in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real
and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hat pin it's very very sharp
and i'm going to just sterilize at a tiny bit can
this is really my flesh this is not damian's special grown flesh that's my skin right there this is not a holy with special effect i am going to pierce my skin and a run this needle through to the other side
if you're queasy if you're if you faint ease i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night and some people that i didn't know and one woman almost past out so i suggest if you're me if you'd get queasy easy that look a wave for about the next thirty in fact i know aunt i'll do the first bad part behind you'll get to see you can look away too if you like to
ah so here's what happens right here at the beginning of my flesh ah at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce
i'm sorry ma'am that i might free king you out now and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this
now essentially were in the same position we were in with the knife trick
a sort of
but you can't count my fingers right now can you smith sell me show em to you that's one two three four five aspa
i know what people think when they see this they go well he would certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes
so me give you a little peak
was that looked out there petty good n
i no
and the people in the back of oke i didn't really see the people in sadlite room or like starting to move in now we give you a good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a hollywood special effect that's my flesh
and i can twist that around i'm sorry i don't if you're getting queasy look away don't look at the thing
people in the back or people on video years from now watching a sigh ye that looks kind of neat and n
some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be seen as a whole there in a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding
il me work up some blood for him
a s
normally now i would take the needle out i would clean of my arm and i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of
taking something take and making it into something real i'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage
i will be seeing you several times or the next few days i hope you're looking forward to that thank you forever
if i can leave you with one big idea to day it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information overlowed
what i'd like you to think about is how we can use information to that patterns pop and we can see trins that would otherwise be invisible so what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age this
tool that i'm using here is a little experiment is called pivet and with pivet what i can do is i can choose to filter on one particular cause of death say accidents and right away i see there's a different pattern that emerge us
this is because in the mid are here people are their most active and over here there their most frail we can step back out again and then reorganize the day that by cause of death
seeing that circulatory diseases and cancers are the usual suspects but not for every one if we go ahead and we fill her
by age say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about
and be drawn to that is especially the case from that so you get the idea that viewing information doing gate in this way is a lot like
swimming and a living information and vographic and if we can do this for raw data why not do it for content as well
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sport illustrate it ever produced
it's all here it's all in the web you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk with pivet you can drill into a decade you can drill into a particular year you can jump right into a specific issue
so i'm looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue the sports i'm a land's armstrong fan so i'll go ahead and all cook on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lance armstrongs been a part of
now if i wanted just kind of take a peek at these i might think well what about taking look at all of cycling so i can step back and expand on that and i see grugglaman now
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrow broader backing and backing out you're not searching you're not browsing you're doing something that's actually a little bit different it's in between an
we think it changes the way information can be used so i want extrapolate on this idea bit with something that's a little the crazy what we've done here is we've taken every single wiccapetia page and we reduced it down to a little summer so the summery consist of just little synopsis and i con to indicate the topical aria that it comes from i'm only showing the top five hundred most popular wiccapetia pages right here but even in this limited view
we can do a lot of thanks right away we get a sense of what are the topical domains of our most popular in wycopedia i'm gon to go ahead and slicked government
now having selected government i could now see that the wickapedia categories that most frequently correspond to that our time magazine people of the year
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wickapetia page it's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them looking at one of these particular somers i can then drill into the concept of
time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them so looking at these people i can see that the majority come from government
some have come from natural sciences
some few are still have come from business
there's my boss and
one is come from music
and interestingly enough bone was also ted prize winner
so we can go jump and take a look at all ted prize winners so you see we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web not from page to page but at a higher level of abstraction
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch a little bit by surprise i'm just showing the new york times wept it here so pivot this application i don't want a call to browsers really not a browser
but you can view wed pages with it and we bring that zumable technology to every single wed page like this so i can step back
pop right back into a specific section now the reason why this is important because by virtue of just viewing wet pages in this way i can look at in my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill in to what i've done
over specific time frames here in fact is the state of all the demo that i just gave and i can sort of replace and stuff that i was looking at earlier to day
and if i want to step back and look at every thing i can slice and die my history perhaps by my search history
here i is doing some nepotistic searching looking for being over here for live laps pivet and from these i can drill into the weas and just launch them again it's one meadow for
re purpose multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the day die so
right now in this world we think about data as being this curse we talk about the curse of information overlowed we talk about
drowning and dada what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down
so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hit it if we can do that then instead
of being tract and data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge and if we get the knowledge that there may be these from theirs wisdom to be found so that i thank you
i grew up on a steady diet of sides fiction in high school i i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book
sides fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this ah in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had in and a
you know that curiosity also manifested itself and in them
the fact that whenever i was in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking
samples of frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and ringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was an all i was real sides cabot it was all about trying to understand
understand the world understand the the limits of a possibility and my love of cid's fiction
i actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late sixties
ah you know we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans a jakusto was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in all wondrous world that we could never really have
previously imagined so that seem to resonat with the whole science fiction part of it
and i was a an artist ah i could draw like a paint and and i i found that because there weren't in ovidio games and this saturation of sigi moves on and all of this imagery in the media landscape
i had to create these images in my head out you don't we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author's description put something on on the screen of the moby screen in our heads and so my
response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class in a dulling behind the behind the text book and
that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened that the jakusto
shows ah now you got me very excited about the fact that there was an alian world right here on earth i might not really go to an alan world ah on a space ship some day ah that that seemed pretty on pretty darn unlikely
but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth it was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined ah from reading these books
so ah i decided i was going to become a scubadiver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean
but i didn't let that daunt me ah i pestered my father until he finally found a ascuboclass in in a buffalo new york right across the border from where we live
and i actually got certified ah in a pool at a whimsies in the dead of winter and buffalo new york and
i didn't see the ocean a a real ocean for another two years until we though we moved to california and now since then in on in the in the intervening
forty years ah i've i've spent about three thousand hours under water and five hundred hours of that was in submercibles and i have learned that that
that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so a rich and with a with amazing life
that really is beyond beyond our imagination in nature's imagination is so
so boundless compared to our own a meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is
is on going and and just as strong as it ever was but a i when i when i chose a career as an adult a
it was fill making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges to a trade images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic books and so so fill making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that
i chose to tell where science fiction stories terminator alians then the abyss and with the abyss ah i i was putting together my love of under water and diving with film making soap
merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was
that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature
ah we actually embraced a computer generated animation a sage and
this a this resulted in the first soft surface character se ge animation that was ever in a in a moving
and even though shinin make any money i barely broke even i should say i witness something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic in its arthur clark's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical
and so that that gat got me very excited and i thought now this is this is something it needs to be embraced into the synematic art so with the terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ilam we created the liquid metal
deed in that film that success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result a with an audience although we did make a little more money on that way ah so
now draw a line through those those two two dots of ex of experience came to us this is goin to be a whole new world this is a whole new world of creativity for
for film artists so i i started a company with stam winston my good friend stand winston who is a h the premier make up and in creature designer
ah at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog paths the kind of analogue processes of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while
but we found ourselves lagging in the in the midnights in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do
so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
of a visual effects of se ge effects beyond with realistic a human in motive ah characters generated in s g in the main characters of bias g and the world would be in sigi and a
now the envelope pushed back and i was told by ah the folks at my company that we weren't goin to be able to do this for a while so i shoved it and i made this other moving about a big ship that sinks
and you no i went and pitch it to the studio as romio and juliet on a ship at kuno be this epic romance passionate
the film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic and that's why i made the move
and that's the true no studio didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we're gon to dive to the wreck were on a film ent for real will be using it in the opening of the film and be really important by a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding and expedition
sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality whose actual created a reality where six months later i found myself in a russian submercibl
two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a vapor natamouvi not ached for real
now that that bloom my mind and you know i took a lot of preparation we had to build camors and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this
dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical and a required enormous planning and you get in this capital you go down to this dark hostile a environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself
and ye no i've thought well i'm i'm like living in a science fiction move this is really cool
and so i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was in experience
that hollywood couldn't give me cause you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions
i was seeing creatures at hydra thermal vance and and sometimes things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them so i was completely smitten by this
and had to do more and so i actually made a cone curious decision after the success of titanic i said o cainomona park my day job as a holly wood moving maker an i'm goin to go be a full time explorer for a while
and so you on we started planning these these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and and exploring it with a with a robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic wreck we took little bots that we had created this spool of fibre optic
and the idea was to go in indo an interior survey of that ship ah which had never been done nobody ever looked inside directed didn't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it
so you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submerciful and looking out at planks that looked much like this where i knew that the that the band had played
and i'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the through the corridor of the of the ship you know when i say i know i'm i'm i'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle
i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was the most cereal canadeja voo experience i i've ever had because
i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set for months when we were making the move
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blue prints of the ship so there was this absoltly remarkable experience in it really
made me realize that you tell the tell presents experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars then your consciousness
is is in injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence and was really really quite profound and it may be a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening of some decades out as a
as we start to have a sideboard bodies for exploration or for other means and in many sort of a post human futures that that i can imagine as a science fixing pan so having done these these a
ah expeditions ah and and in a really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vents where we had these
amazing amazing animals they're bad basile alias right here on earth they live in a environment of kamo synthesis they don't survive
on sunlight based system the way we do and so you're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree senigrade water plums that you think they can't possibly exist at the same time
i was getting very interested in space science as well again and it's the science fiction influence as a kid
and i wound up getting involved with the the space community really involved with the with naa sittin on the nassavisry board planning a actual space missions going to russia going through the pre cosmo biometical protocols and all these sorts of things
to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three the camas systems and this was fascinating but what what i want up doing was bringing space scientist with us into the deep
and taking them down so that they had access master biologists planetary scientist people who are interested in these extreme of file environments
taking them down to the vents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so and so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space sides
i had completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan in o as a kid and doing this stuff for real
and in along the way that in this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about
leadership now you think directors go to be a leader leader of captain the ship all it's hurting i nearly learn about leadership until
i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this what o i get out of it
we don't make money at these dam shows you no we barly break even here no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails some place i now sitting at the beach made all these films made all these documentary films that you on't for very
limited audience no fame no glory no money what are you doing you're doing it for the task itself for the challenge
and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens
when a small group of people form a tightly knit tin case we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time
sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing
is the respect that you have for them that they have for you that you have done a task
that you can't explain to some one else when you come back to the shore and you say we now we had to do this and the fibroptic in the attenuation and this and that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea
you can't explain it to people it's that thing that that may be cops have or people in in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond creates a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next move which was abatar
i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team and you are in their respect in return and i really changed the dynamic so here i was again with a small team
and you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didn't exist before tremendously exciting ah tremendously challenging and we became a family
over a four and half year period a completely changed how i do move so people of comment at on how you now will you brought back the ocean a organisms and put them on the planet a pan door to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself the change as a result of that
so what can we sent the size out of all this you know what's the what of the lessons learn well i think number one is curiosity it's the most powerful thing you own imagination
is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world
and i have young filmikers
come up to me and say you give me some advice for doing this
and i say
don't put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you don't do it to yourself don't bet against yourself and and take risks a an asa has this has this a phrase that they like failure is not an option
but failure has to be an option in art and an exploration because it's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation
was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that's the thought i would leave you with is it in whatever you're doing failure
is an option but fear is not that you e
i'm game once i'm a game designer and i been making games on thine now for ten years and my gold for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in on line games
now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time
playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing on line games some of you might be thinking
that's a lot of time to spend playing games may be too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future a it's actually the opposite is true
three million hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact
i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i have calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week
so that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idea so i'll just i'll say it again let it sink in an if we want us all problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity
i believe that we need to aspire to play aims all mine for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade
no i'm serious
i am here is why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly
this is a portrait by a photographer named phil toldano he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic
gaming emotion now ah if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the new aunts in this photo you probably see the sense of urgent see a little bit of
fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem a if you are a gamer you will notice a few new antes here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprise this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic win now an
ah you heard of that o ka good and we have some givers among it so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it ah it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epic in
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem salvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of some one
who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in every day life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and has actually me
making it can you see it yes good o this sexually mean making that i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graft in my old neighborhood in berkley california where i did my peach de on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although that's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate and when we're in game worlds
i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves though most likely to help at a moment's notice though most likely to stick to a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again am and in real life
when we when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical
we never have those feelings on were playing games they just on existing games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a gray as student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we
take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of war craft which is really the ideal collaborator problem soving environment and i started to notice a few things that make
epic winds so possible and all mine worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of the all mine games especially in world of war craft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission
right away but not just any mission is a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve
but it is on the the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of war craft there's no sitting around wringing your hands is always something specific
and important to be done an they are also tons of laborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people
ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission as not something we have in real life that easily the sunset at our finger tips are tons of collaborators and also there is epic story this inspiring story of why were there
and what we're doing and then we get all this positive fee back you gus have heard of leveling up and plus one string and plus one intelligence all we don't get that kind of constant fee back in real life when i get off the stage i'm not goin to have you know plus one speaking and plus one
crazy idea a plus tiny crazy idea ah i don't get that fee back in real life ah now the problem with collaborate on mine of varmints like world of war crowd
is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epiguin all the time that we decide to spend all her time in these game worlds is just better than reality so so far am collectively all the world of work have eamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth now
that's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when
our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate o he so when we talk about how much time fer curly investing and playing games
the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution ah which is an extraordinary thing but it's also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games were actually changing
what we are capable of as human beings were evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species this is true i believe is so consider this really interesting statistic
i was recently published by recent carnage melon university the average young person to day in a country with a strong gamer culture
will have spent ten thousand hours playing on line games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all
for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school
and some of you have probably read malcom glad well's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hours theory of success is based on this great cogenof science research that if we can master
ten thousand hours of effort full study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuosos at it we'll be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world am and so
now what were looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is
what exactly our gainers getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing on line games these are our virtuous of gamers five hundred million people who are extraordinarily good at something
and in the next decade were an to have another billion gamers who are externally good
at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consuls that are low energy and that work with the wireless foam net works instead of a broad band internet so that game is all over the world particularly in india
china brazil can get on line they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade so bring us up to one point five billion gamers
so i've started to think about what these games are making us virtuous as that here the four things i came up with
the first is urgent optimism can i think of this is extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
gamers always believe that an epic one is possible and that is always worth trying and trying now games don't sit around
ca gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they beaten us badly
the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with some one we trust that they will spend their time with us the they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trusts and cooperation am and and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result
blissful productivity i love it nor teres a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game they were actually happier working hard then we are
relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optamized as human beings to do hard meaningful work and games are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work finally epic meaning
gamors love to be attached to all inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective am so you all know wicked petya
biggest wicky in the world second biggest wicky in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of war craft wicky
five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of war craft on the inner net than any other topic covered on any other wicky in the world they are building an epic story they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of war craft o case of these are four super powers that add up
to one thing gamers are super impowered hopeful individuals
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that's the problem that i am trying to salve
ah there is an economic in edward castanova whose work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in a line worlds
and he says we're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass excites to virtual whirls and an line game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says
that like me emma game design or un exuberant but he says he says
that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in all mine world than they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feed back and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says
for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world now
i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to start making the real world walk more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened
twenty five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep nuckles right before we had some game controllers we had sheep nuckles and at these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings
an if your familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian heroditus you might know this history ah which is the history of who invented games and why
herodotus says that games particular dice games were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine
that the king of lydia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution
so according to roditis they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy
on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and the would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity
they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day they would play games and on the next day they would eat and according to heroditis
they passed eighteen years this way surviving through a famine by eating on monday and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how are using games to day
we're using games to escape real world's suffering were using games to get away from everything that is broken in the real environment everything that's not satisfying about real life
and we're getting what we need from games but it doesn't have to end there this is really exciting according to heroditus after eighteen years the famine was in getting better so the king decided they would play one final this game
they divided the entire kingdom and half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go
on an epic adventure they would leave lydia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people
to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive now this sounds a crazy right
but recently diane evidence has shown that the etruscans who then led to the roman empire actually share the same diana as a ancient lydians and so
recently scientists have suggested that herodotus's crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might have actually
saved their culture by playing games escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually saved the entire civilization that way o t we can do that
we have been playing war craft since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time strategy game from the world of work half series that was sixteen years ago
they play die games for eighteen years we've been playing work half for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now
they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so that's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of game play
from let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour day playing games until we solve real world problems now i know you are asking
how are we in the sore problems and games well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future
we have his banner in our offices and paloalto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict to the future but we want to do is make the future
we want to imagine the best case an arrow outcome an then we want it in power people to make that outcome a reality we want to imagine epic winds and then give people the means to achieve the epic win
i'm just goin to very briefly show you three games that i've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epoquins in their own futures
so this is whirled without oil we made this game in two thousand seven this is an online game in which you try to survive and oils shortage
the oil shortage is fictional but we put enough on line content out there for you to believe that it's real and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil so when you come to the game
you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news vitious data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs what's not available how food supplies being affected how transportations being affected if schools are closed if there's riding and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to block about it
to post vos to post photos we've piloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand seven and we've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transform it of experience nobody wants to change how they live just because
it's good for the world or because reposed to but if you immersem in an epic adventure and tell them
we've run out of oil this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits they learn in the game
so for the next world saving game we decided to aim higher bigger problem than just peak oil ah we did a game called superstoc at the institute for the future
and the premise was a super computer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet the super computer was called the global extinction aware no system of course we asked people to come on line almost like a jerry bruckhar move
ou know jerry buckham removes you form a dream team you've got the arnot the scientist the ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world
but in our game instead of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody's on the dream team and it's your job
to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net
we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks that came up with five hundred insanely creative solutions that you can go on line if you gug superstructancy
so finally the last game were launching at march third this is a game done with the whirl bank institute if you complete the game you will be
certified by the world bank institute as a social enevator class of two thousand ten working with universities all over subsehare in africa and we are inviting them to learn social enevation skills we've got a graphic novel
we've got leveling up in skills like local insight knowledge net working sustain ability vision and resourcefulness i would like to bite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing arias who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
some get a wrap up now i went to ask a question what do you think happens next we've got all these amazing gamers we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved the real world yet
well i hope that you will agree with me that amours are a human resource that we can use
to do real world work that games are powerful platform for change we have all these amazing super powers blissful productivity the ability to weave a tight social fabric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning i really hope that we can come together
to play games at matter to survive on this planet for another century and that's my hope that yo will join me in making and playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure
that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so i say let the world changing games begin thank you
i pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tetish machine and it's a time machine in every one in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you can not stay where you are
and i wonder what you choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know the man to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle ah
i don't know i'm i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nastasa to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm that part of that crowd i have to say
i do want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward
this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth
mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grand parents
died all of them by the time they were sixty my grand parents pushed that number to seventy my parents are closing in unity so ah
there'd better be a there better be a nine in the beginning of my death number ah but it's not in in about people like us because
this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delly to day can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago
to think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true
small pocks ma pox killed millions of people on this planet it reshaped the democraphy of the globe in a way that no war ever has it's gone
it's vanished we've vanquished it put in the rich world
diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly dip thuria rubella pollio does anyone even know what those things are
that seems modern medicine or ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out
seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news
unfortunately that's all the good nuns because there some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that
despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world
every day back numbers rising and its rising early rapidly and its disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination
to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rain forests oil gas they're going away
and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mass we're going away to
so the question is can we do that and i i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food there will feed millions of people without reaping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it
i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here is the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night
we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can to day we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields
and yet i actually think we'd ought to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on more french
than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them fruit and listen
every one's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out
about a decade ago i wrote a story about that scenes for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effect of public health measure in human history
i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that
i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so
i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was frank in foods why they thought moving lawlkils around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground
but you know i do what i do i wrote the story i move down i mean on a journalist
we tip we fill we go to dinner it's fun
but these stories bother me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people
they were exactly like the people in this room
and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world
where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress
o kay there are reasons for that and i think we know with those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there that there is no reason we should of you can just say a few names and people will understand
turnoble bopaul the challenger
vyachs weapons of mass destruction hanging chas
i mean you know you can choose your list
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right so be skeptical
ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof
you need to accept the proof and we're not thout good at doing that
and the reason that i can say that is because we are now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story
that linked the epodemic of autism to the measles months and rebella vacinshot
very scary tones of studies were done to see if this was true tongs of studies should have been done it's an asserious issue
the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada an it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what
the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a fact
the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for mussels is going down
that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible
and what kind of what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now
i understand it i do understand it because the any one have musels here to one person in this audience ever see some one die of musls
doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened a hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour
but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jenny macarthy
can go around preaching messages of fear and a literacy from platforms like opera and larry king live
and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but there almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon
the sky was a hero john i saw he took one of the worst skurges of mankind away from us no fear no agony pollio pofgone
not i in the middle not so much his name is paul alte
he just developed a road of pirate racine with a bunch of other people it will save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand
kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it's good except that paul does around talking about back scenes and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the whining and actually says it that way so pose terrorist
when pa speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school
and why because pa made a vac scene i don't need to say this but facings are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have musles in this country now
and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are on a die a gun because it's just a numbers game and he not just canady of measles what about polo let's have that
why not a college class made of mine wrote ly a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought i was a little strident notes ever so that before a
she wasn't going to vaccinate her kit against polo no way fine
why because we don't have polo an you know what we didn't have polo in this country yesterday to day adone may be got got on a plain in lagos this morning and he's flying to alex rite now is over ohio
and he's got a land in a couple hours ago to rent a car and he's goin to come to long beach and he's goin to tend one of these fabulous ted dinners to night and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on
don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves and lives we love to do it every one take their vidaments this morning
at an me shall little i can mate little any accident to get your going
i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take all turn of medicines and it doesn't matter how often we set
find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your earn they almost never do more than that
i a cat you want to pay twenty eight million dollars for dark year and i'm totally with you
dark you're in dark
why do we do that why do we do that i think i understand we hate big farmer we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks
it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold
and sol deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo
that's fine taste i love big or fed
but you know it's not it's it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend millions of dollars on it and i have all sorts of little proper
none of the dingo rad
econasia froth a c i don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud
and you know what when i say the stuff people screamed at me and they say wouldn't care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because
i don't care if it's the secretary of atra jos
who saying whom i'm not goin to take the evidence of my experts on the mamograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient
with coffee animals when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence and science you went up in a place you don't want to be
you end up in tabor and becky south africa he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting
that beat root garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the anti retroviral jugs we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease
please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now
the most mindless apodomic were in the middle of rios this absurd battle between
proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic let it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors
it's ideology is not science
every single thing we eat every grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brustle sprat has been modified by man you are the work tangerines in the garden of eden
there wasn't any cantelope
there were christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years
and some of it worked and some of it didn't we got rid of the stuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and their risks
absolutely but we can put something like vitamin a into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lodge
you dont want to do that i have to say i don't understand it a we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that while the things i constantly here are
too many chemicals pasta sides hormones
minarculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing it's wrong
we don't want company's patting life we don't want company's owning seeds and you know my response to all that is yes
you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science
this has nothing to do with science its law its morality its pate stuff you know science isn't a company it's not a country
it's not even an idea it's a process
it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid
is really very deadening in its preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next
fifty years were i to have to grow seventy per cent more food than we do right now seventy per cent this is investment in africa over last thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why
genetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance co save as something that health a billion people lead its kind like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it's sups
it doesn't have newtrians it doesn't have procintan scientists or engineering all of that into it right now
and then people would be able to eat in and they'd be able to not go blind if they wouldn't starve and you know what that wud be nice wouldn't be shaped penice but it would be nice
and all i can say about this is
why are we fighting it why let's ask ourselves why we funny it because we don't want to move games or other is about moving guns around it's not about chemicals
it's not about our ridiculous passion for hor moments our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food
this isn't about rice christie's this about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't
if we continue to act the way we're acting we're guilty of something that i don't think we want to be guilty of high tateronialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish
it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it
so after this amazingly fund conversation
it might want to say so you are so in agin this ridiculous time machine and go forward
an absolutely absolutely i do it's struck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on any thing we want we can move it where we want to move it
and we're on to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead
we're in to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as i'm concerned
that's something the world needs right now i

one day los angeles times call miss stivlopas was walking along the streets of down town lassanjelus when he heard
beautiful music and the source was a man
an african american man charming rugged homeless playing a violin that only had two strings
i am telling a story that many of you know because steve's columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a move
with robert downie junior acting a stivelopas and jamie fox says nathaniel anthony airs the julliard trained double basis whose promising career was cut short
by a tragic affliction with paranoid skitzophrenia
nathaniel dropped out of juliard he suffered a complete break down and thirty years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in danton lasantelis i encourage all of you to read steve's book or to watch the move to understand not only the beautiful bond
that form between these two men but how music helped shape that bond and ultimately was instrumental if you'll pardon the pun in helping the thane get off the streets
i met mister ayres in two thousand eight two years ago at aldine concert hall he had just heard a performance of batoven's first and fourth symphonies and came back stage and introduced himself when speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about ooma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never on to make the world series all because of the treacherous first violent passage work in the last movement of batoven's fourth symphony
and we got talking about music and i got an e male from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me now i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment
because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorozin and handcuffs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
but as a result now he is prone to these skitzophrenic apesodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding
and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skid row exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at walters ne concert hall he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes he was lost
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how some one was poisoning him in his sleep and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraid that i was to allus him that he was going to sink into one of his states
and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpegyois and other exciting forms of didactic violin petigoti
so i just started playing
and i played the first movement of the beato in valence curt and as i played i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniel's eyes
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible farm as cuticle a chemical reaction for which my playing the music
was its cattlist and the panel's manic rage
was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity an en grace
and in a miracle he lifted his own violin and he started playing by ear certain snippets of violent concertos which he then asked me to complete mendelson chicoski sibelius
an we started talking about music from bath to be savin and bram's brook near the all the bees from badcock all the way up to esopeca saline and i understood that he not only had an incychlapiet ac knowledge of music
but he related to this music at a personal level he spoke about it with a kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles olimonic
and through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed
from the paranoid disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of don tomas angelus to the charming
air you dit brilliant julia train musician music is medicine
music changes us and for nathaniel music is sanity because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality
and that is an escape from his tormented state
and i understood that this was the very essence of art this is the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core our emotions
and through our artistic lens through our creativity were able to shape those emotions into reality
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us inspires and unites us
and for nathaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him
and i will always make music with nathaniel whether we ar at walt is in concert hall or on skid row because he reminds me why i became a musician thank you
all lallllllll all
ever go do
and in a place so in that i shamelessly stole from chelles so please forgive me
several years ago here at ted peter skill men introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge and the ideas pretty simple teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of twenty sticks of spigetty one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow the marshmallow has to be on top and though it seems really simple it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorporate it into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then i've
conducted about seventy design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the setios of the fortune fifty and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i like to share some of them with you so
normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figure out what is gone look like they jacky for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketching they lay out spigetti a they'd spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures and then
finally just as they're running out of time some one takes out the marsh mellow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back
and cut
they admire their work but what really happens most of the time is that the ada turns into an oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so
there are a number of people who have a lot more o moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
they lie that a cheap they get distracted they've and they produce really lamed structures and of course there is teams that have a lot more to do structures and among the best are recent graduates of kinder garden
and h
it's pretty amazing as peter tells us how not only do do they produce the tallest structures but the most interesting structures of them all so the question you won't ask is how come
why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of us none of the kids spend any time trying to be sovspegaty ink
right they don't tie it spend time joking for par but there's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan
right and then they execute on it an then what happens as when they put the marshmallow on top they run out of time and what happens it's a crisis
found familiar right hoke wat kinder gardeners do differently is that they start with the marsh mellow and they build prototype successive prototypes
always keeping the marsh nello and top so they have multiple times ad to to fix in bill prototypes along the way so the liners recognized this type of collaboration
as the essence of the iterative process and with each version kids get instant fee back about what works and what doesn't work
so the capacity to play in prototype is is really essential but let's look at how different teams perform
so the average for most people is around twenty inches business school students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kinder gardens better than most adults who does the very best
architects and engineers thankfully and
thirty nine inches the tallest structure a i've seen and why is it because they understand triangles and self reenforcing geometrical patterns or the key to building self a reinforce or the stable structures
so i see os little bit better than average but here's where gets interesting if you put in an executive admen on the team they get significantly better
credible you now
you look around you go out that teams go now in a dotal beforehand and why is that because they have special skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays a close attention to to work
ah will significantly improve the team's performance special it skills and facilitation skills as the combination leads to to strong success
you have ten teams a typically performed you'l get maybe six or so that i've standing structures and i i tried something interesting i thought let's a
up the anti once so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of soft war to the winning team so what do you think happened to these designed students what was the result
here's would happen there r
not one team had a standing structure not one had a a if anyone had built say o o one instructor they dointaken on the the prize so isn't an interesting that high stakes have a strong impact we did the exercise again with the same students what d you think happened then so now the understand the value of prototyping
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produce the tallest structures in the least amount of time so there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
so you might ask why would any one actually spend time running a marshmallow a challenge and the reason is i to help create digital tools and processes to help the teams build cars and video games and visual effects a
and what the marshmallow challenge doses that helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly
every project has its own marshmallow as net that the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you are interested may wonder go to marshmallow challenge dodcommange a blog that you can look at how to build a the marshmallows or step by step instructions on this a there are
crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system there's world records that are on this as well
and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport ah it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from a and o moment to a tadammoment and that can make a big difference thank you very much
