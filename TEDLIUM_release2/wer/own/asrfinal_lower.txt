i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep mytpisars handy everam writing anything but
ihad already finished editing the pieace and i realized thati had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
disabled ajitive crippled helpless useless rect
stalled mamed wounded mangled lame mutilated
run down worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handycaped
senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
see also hurt useless and weak antinems healthy strong capable
i was reading this lissout loud to afriend andatferst was laughing it was so ludicrous but just gottenpastmangled
when my voice broke andi had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
ah ananimpactthat the assault from these words unleashed
noani'm of course is is my raggedy oldvhesarrsi'm thinking this must be ancient printdateright but infact eprintit was the early nineteen eaighties
when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unitandas related to the other kids ind the world around me and needlesstosay thank god i wasn't using itthesorrus backthen
imeanfrom this entury it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when infacttoday
i'm celebrated fir ah the opportunities andadventures my life have procured so i immediately
went to lookup two thousand nine aonline adition expecting to find arivisionworth noting here's the updated version of this entry
unfortunately it's not much better i find thee the lasttwo words undernear antinums particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
so it's not justabout the words
it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words about thevalues behind the words andhow weconstruct those values our language affects our thinking
and how we view the world and how we view other people infact many ancient societies including the greeks inthe romans believed that to utter acurse
verbily was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
so what reality do we wanto call into existence a person who is limited or person who'simpowered
by casually doing something as symble as naming a person achild
we might be pudding lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we wanto open doors for them instead
onceataperson who openedoors for me was mychildhood doctor attheadipant institute in welmington delaware his name is doctor peetsatillo
amnoanitalian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor pe and doctor p
always wore really colorfulboties and amhad the very perfect disposition to work with children
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical fereprecessions
i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands adifferent colors youknow
to help build up my leg muscles andi hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
yuno i was already bargainingat fidrold child with doctor peeto try to get out of doinghese exercises unsuccessfully of course
and one day he came in to mysession amexhaustive and unforgiving
thessessions and he said to me wa ami youare such a strong powerful little girl
i think yu'regongto break one ofthose bands when you do breakit imointogive you hundredbox now corse thiswas a simpleploy
on doctorpea'spart togetme todo the exerciseasi didn't wanto do before the prospectof being the richest fidyarold in the secondfloorward
but whathe affectedly did for me was reshaped an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself asan inherently strong powerful and atholetic person wellinto the future
this is an example of how adultsinpositions of power canignite the power of a child
but in the previous instances of those thesarasentry yet our language isn't allowing us to envolve intothereality that we would all want
northepossibility of an individual to see themselves is capable
our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of whichaebeen brought about by technology certainly from medical standpoint
my legs ahnolazor surgery for visionimperament tytanium knees and hipreplacemens for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with theirabilities and move beyond the limits that nature is imposed on them
not to mention social networking platforms allows people to selthidentify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go alinewith global groups of their ownchoosing
thouhperhaps hycknowledgy is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been atruth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
and that thehumanability to adapt is our greatestascet ahumanability to adaptis an interesting thing because people
have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
and i'manammakean admission thisprays never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and ithink i'm starting to figureout why
implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
as if my successes in life have come about from anability to sidestep or circumnavogate the presume pitballs oftalifewith proschetics or what other people perceiveis my disability
but infact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge wether physically emotionally or both and ominous suggest that this is a good thing
adversity isn't an obstacle that we needtoget around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
and i tentothink of it like my shadow sometimes i feelot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
certainly i'm not trying to diminish butimpact the weight of a person's struggle there is
adversityand challenge in lifeandit's all very real andrelative to everysingle person but the question isn't whether ornot youregitimet dversity but howaryou'regoing to meet it
so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
and wedo adisservice to our kids when we make them feel thathey're not equipped to adapt
there'san important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being anamputie and the subjective socitalopinion of whether or not i'm disabled
and truthfully the only real and consistent dissibility i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be describedbythose definitions
in our desire to protect those we careabout by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognoses
or indeedaprognosis on the expected quality of their lifes we have to make sure that we don't put the first brickin a wall that will actually
disable somebody perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken inyou and how to we fix it
serves to be more disabling to the individual than thepathology itself by not treating the wholeness of aperson
by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
we are esfactivly grading someone's worth to our community so we need tosee through thepathology andintothe range of human capability
andmost importantly thereis a partnership between those perceived efficiencies and our greatest creative ability
so it's not about devaluing oraneggating me's more trying timesas something we wanto avoid or sweep under the rug but instead tofind those opportunities
wracked in the adversity so maybethe idea i want to put out thereis not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
embracing it grappling with it they's restling term maybeven dancing with it
andperhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful were less burdened by the presence of it
this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwine and itwas a hundred fifty years ago when wriding about evolution thedarwine illustrated ithink atruth about the human character
toparophrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives itis the one that is most adaptable to change
conflict is the genisis of creation from darwine's work amongstothers we can recognize that the humanability to survive and flourish
is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit threuwgh conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
human skill andperhaps you know untillwe're tested wedontknowe're made of maybethat'swhat adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
so we can give ourselves agift we can reimagine adversity andsomething more than just tofhtimes
maybe we can seeit is change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves too yet
ithink the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalty
andwho's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
thre's no normal and would you wanto meet that poor base person if theyexisted idon't think so if we can change this paradime from one of
achieving normalty to one ofpossibility or potency doweeven ltlbitmore dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
theyarerare andvaluable abilitiis with community antherpologis tell us that the one thing weas humans have always required ofour community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
there's evidence that neanderthaults sixty thousand years ago carried theyeare elderly and those withserious physical injury
and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
they didn't view these people as brokeen and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
a few years ago was inafoodmarket inthe townwhere i grew up and that redzoanand northeastern pensylvania
and i was standing over a bushel ofatomatoes itwas summertime ihadeshortson i heard thisgy his voice behind me say well if it isn't ameinmullins
i turn around andishis olderman ihave no idea who is andi saidah i'm sorry sir idon'
have wemet iidon't remember meeting you yousaiwilyouwulnt remember meeting me wewhen we met i was delivering you from your mother's woom
meoh thatgy nomotamdof course actually
it did click this man was doctor kean aman that ihad only knownabout throuhmy mother's stories of that day because of course
thypical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks and so my mother's prenadal physician had goneonvacasion so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
and because i wasborn withat thesiblabones andhadfeet turned inand fewtoesonthis footinaffutosan tat he had to be the bearer the stranger
had to be the bearer of badnews he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
and youwould never have the kind of nobility that otherkis have or anykind of lifeof independence and you'vebeen making alier atame ever since
theextraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaperclipping throughout my whole childhood
whether winningas secondgrade pellingbe marching with thegirlscowds youknow the holoweamprade winning mycollag scholarship or any of my sports victories
and he was using it inintegrating itinto teaching resident students medstudents from hanamen
medical school and hurtey medical school andhecalled this partof the coarse the exfactor hewastpotential of the human will
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be inthatas determinate inthequality of someone's life
anddoctor king went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
and even if givenamatama modicum of support is left to their own devices achild will achieve
to doctor kene made that shift andthinking he understood thathre's difference between themedical condition and what someone might do with it
andthre's been ashiftin mythinking overtime and that if youhad ask me at fifteen years old if i would havetrayedit prothetics for fleshandbownelegs i wouldn't have hesitated for second
i aspired tothatkind ofnormalsey backthen ask me today not so sure
and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and castshadows on me
toall you really need is one person to show you the apifiny of your own power andyouroff if you canhand somebody the key
to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that andopenta door for someoneatacrucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
you're teaching them to open doors for themselves exacttheexact meaning ofthe word educate
comesfrom the rootword educe it means to bring forth whatis within to bring out patential so again which potential do we wanto bringout
therewas casestadydone in nineteen sixty'sbreaton when they were moving from compria grammar schools to comprehensive chools called streaming triales we call it tracking
here in the states its separating students from ndsoon
and youknow the aystudents get thetopercoriculum thebest teachers eccetera while they took overa theemonth period delevelstudents gave the mase told them they wereas told them they were bright and at the end of this thremonth period
they were performing atalevel and of course the harpbreaking flipsideof thestudy isthat they took the students
and toldhem they were deas and that's what happened athe end of that three month period those who were still around school bsides the drotpeople had dropped out
tisses the corucial part of of this caystudy was that the teachers were duped too
the teachers didn'tknow aswitch had been made they were simply told these are the asuns theseare thedeastudnts and that's how they went about teaching them
andtreating them though i think
haththe only true disibility
is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity inour inateability to imagine
if instead we can bosterahuman spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
i'd like to leaveyou with a poem byta fourteenth century persianpoet name hopic
andmy friend jocdamboas told me about and thepoem is called the god who only knows fourwords everychild
has known god not thegod of names not the god of donts but the god who only knows fourwords
and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
howanitalk today about energy andclimate
and that might seemabit surprising because mifultimework ofthe foundation is mostly about vaxinsandseeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest tubillion live betterlives
but energyand climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet
the climate getting worse means that manyyears their crops won't grow her'llbe toomuch reignd notenough reign
things will change in ways that their feragul environment simply can't support and that leads tostarvation leads touncertainty itleads unrest so thatthe climate changes will be terrible for them
also the price of energyis veryimportanto them infactifyou couldpick just one thing tolorfthepricob reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down overtime
really advanced civilization based onaadvances indinenergy thecoldrevolution fuweled
theindustrialrevolution and evenin the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid declinein the price of electricity andthat's why we have erfrigerators airconditioning we can make modern materialsinddo so many things
and so wereinta wonderful situation with a electricity in the rich world
but as we make cheaper and let's say let'sgo for making ita twices cheap we need tomeen a new constraint
and that constraint has todo with seotu seotu is warming theplanet
and the ocquasiononseo to is actually avery straightforward one if yousum up the seotoo that gets abmitted
that leads to a temperature increase and that temprature increase leads some very negative effacts theeffects on the weather
aperhaps worse the indirecteffacts in that ofthe natrallegal systems cantajustto these rapid changes and so youget echosystemcolopses
now the exact amount of how youmap from acertain increasein ofsioto
to what temperaturewill beinwearthe positivefebacks art there'ssome uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainlyuncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
i asked the topsientistand several times do we really have to get down tonearzer can't we just an'lcutinahalf or quarter and the answer is that until we get nearto zero
the temperature will continue torise andso that's that's a big challenge it's very different than saying inaword twelvefoothigh truck tryin toget under a tenfootbridge and wecantoasort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zerol
now weput out a lot of carpendioxide every year i'llovertwenty sixbillion tons offereach american
it's about twenty tuns ah for people inpoorcountries it's less than one ton tsanaverage about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that we'll bring that downto zero
it'sbeen constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have evend flatenedit all so we have to go fromrapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zerol this ocquasionas orfactors
littlebitomultiplication soyougot thing onthe leftseotoothat you wanttoget tozero and that'sginto be based on thenumberofpeople
theservices each personjosing onaverage the energy onaveragepreach service and theseotoo beingput out
apurunitovenergy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this toutinto zero probably one of these numbers is geni have to get pretty nearto zero
that's back fromahighschool agerubutlet's let's take alook ah first we'vegot population
now the worldtoday has sixpointeight billionpeople that'sheaded up to about ninebillion nowif we do a really great job on newbackscenes healthcare
reproductive heldservices wecould lowerthat by perhaps tenor fifteen percent but there wesee an increase about one point three
the second factor is the services we use this incompases everything the foodwe
clothing tev aheating these are very good things agettingrid of poverty means providing these servicees to almost everyone on the planet andit's a great thing
aforthis number togo up in the rich world perhaps thetop one billion we probably could cut backanduse luss but everyyear
this number on avrage is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person
herewe haveavery basic service do you have lightinin your house to be able to read your homwarkaninfact these kids don'tsothe'egoing outand reading their schoolwork under the streetlamps
now efficiency theenergy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's nockgoing up through various inventions and newways of doing lighting
athrough differenttypes of cars adifferentways building buildings thereaea lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially
some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there areother services like how we make ferlizer how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
and so overall here if oreobtimystic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex
but for these first three factors now we'vegone from twenty sixbillions to itbestamaybe thirteen billion tuns and that justwon't cut it so let's look at this fourthfactor there's gon to be a key one
and this is the amount of seotuput out for each unitof energy andso the question is can't you actually get thattozero ahif youburn coal
no afyouburn atogaskanalmost everyway we mayeelectricity today except the emerging runoblesand newclear putsoutseo too and sowe're going to have todo it globalscale
is create a new system andso we need energymiracles now wheniis the termmiracle idon't mean something that's impossible
the micerprocessor is amiracle the personal computersamiracle oftheinnernetnat serviceesare miracle so thepeople hereofperticipated inthe creation of many miracles usually we don'thave deadline
erewe'have get the miracle by certaindate usuallyujuskind standby and somecomalong some don't this is acase where we actulyhave to drive at full speed and get amiracle inaa pretty tighttimeline
nowi thought how could i really capture this is there somekind of naptural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that
it really got them involved in the idea ah nootherepeople wholive squitos so with energy ilike tocomeupwit is this ah i decided thatreleasing fireflies
would be myacontribution tothe invironment hereofthis yeare so herewehave somenowtreply liesi'm told they don't bihtinfacthey mighteven not evenleave that jar ahh
now ther's all sorts of gimiksolutions like thatone ahbut they don't really ad uptoo much we need solutions either one or several thathave
unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions or people seeking i really only see five that
canachieve thebig numbers i've leftouttie thermal fusian viaphuls those may make some contribution andif they can do better than i expect so much the better but my keypointhere
is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them ahbecause they theylookdaunting because they all
havesignificant challenges let's look first at burningpostl fuels either burningcoal orburning naptalgaswhat you nean to do there
seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all theseotoo after you'veburnt it going out thefle preshrisit cradel liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
now we have some pilot things that do this that thesixteeteighty percent lavel butgetting upto that fullpercentage that will be very tricky and agreenom weare these seotoquantitis shouldbe put
i'llbe hard but the tupasone here is this longtremisue who's ginto be sure who's going toguarrantea
something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think ofininterms of newclyor other things this is alot avolume
so that'statopone nextadenuglir it also has three big problems clost particulian highlyregulated countries ashigh
issue ofthe safety really feeling good about nothing cango wrong that hedinotyouhave these human operators that the fuel
doesn'tget used for weapons and then whereit whatdoyou dowith wastealthough it's not very large alterealot of concerns about that people needto feel good about it so three very tompproblems that mightbe asolvable and so should be workedon
the last three of the five i've groupedtogether ahthese are what people often referrdtois therenewable sources and they actually
although it's great they don't requile fuel they have some disadvantages oneis that the dencity
energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than apowerplant this is energy farming
seretalkingabout many squaremiles thousands of times more area thanthanyouthink ofits anormal energy plant also these are intermintant sources ahthe sundoesn't shine
all day itdoesn't shine everyday andlikewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and sofyou depend on these sources
you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we'vegot bigcost challenges here
ah we have transmission challenges for example savethis energy sourceis outside your country ah not only need the technology but you haveto deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storiageproblem
and todimantialize this i went through and looked at all thetypes ofbatteries that get made for cars for computors for fomes for flashlights for everything and compared that
to the amount of electicalenergy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes
of all the energy andso in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be
factorof hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not it'snot impossible but it's not a veryeasy thing now this shows up when you try to get thetheintermentan source to be above say twenty to thirty percent
of what you're using if you're counting onit for hundred percent you need a anincredible miracle battery
now howaregingto go forward on this what's what's therightapproach isitabanhantand project what's thethething that can get us there what we needs wants
of companies aworking on this hundreds in each of these five paths we needleast hundred people andalotofim youllooktand say they're crazy that's good
and i think here in tedgroup we have many people awhoarealready pursuing this ah
pillgroshav several companies inclemonecalled soler that has some great solerthormal technology avanodcosas investingandozens of conpanies ahthata're doing great things andhave interesting possibilities andi'mi'm trying to help back that anathemeriblthan i actualyarebacking acompany
that perhaps surprisinglyis actually taking the newclearaproach ofthereare some inevations in newclear mogler liquid
ah an inevation really stopped in this industry quite sometime agosothe idea that there'some good ideas laying around ahis notallthat surprising the ideaofaterropower
is that instead of burning the partofuranium the one percent ofjusyutothirty five we decidedwillet'sburn theninety nine percent
theyeututhirty eighth it is kind of crazy idean in fact people hadtalked about it for long time
but they could never stimulate properly whether itwould work or not andsoitthrough the adventof modern supercomputers that now you cansimulate andsee that yes with theright
material's approach ah this looks like it would work and because you'reburning that ninetienine percent you have
greatly improved costaprofile youactually burn up the wasteand you canactouseas fuel all the left overwaste from todays reactors andso instead of waring about them youjust take that it's great thing
it breeds this uranium as it goes alongsotkinly liketacandle and sees itsalogthera often referred to usatravelling wayvereactor and terms aful
nowthis really solves the probem i've gotta picturehere ofaplace in contaki this is theleft over the ninety nine percent where they'vetaken out thepart theyburenow so'scalled topleaded juranium that wouldpower the youask
for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater inaninexpensive process youdhave enough for the entire lifetime onthe rest of theplanet so
you know it'sgot lots lots of challengeas i had but it isan example of the many hundreds ond hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
solet's think howshould we measure ourselves whatshould our reportcard i'll looklike well let's go out towhere we really needtoget and and then i'lllook at the intermediate for twenty fifty you'veheard many people talk about
this eighty percant reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by
things going on inpoorcountries still some agriculture hoply we will have cleaned up forestresimant aso to get to that eighty percent the developed countries
including countries like china we'll have hadaswitchtheir electrinelectriity generation alltogether ah so the other greatis are we deploying
this zeromission tecnology havewe deployeditin all the develope countries and werein the processos of getting itoutelsewhere that' superimportant
at'sakeyelement of making that reportcard so backing up from there letsyouthe twenty twenty reportcardlook like
well itagainitshould have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to startgetting reductions the lest we amit the lasthatsum will be of siotuandtherefore thelastthetemperature but in someways the grade we get there
doing things that don't getus all the way to thebig redoctions is only equallyer maybeeven slightly lessimportanthan the other which is the pieaceof inevation
on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that interms of companies pilot projects regulartorythings thathave beenchanged
ther's alot of greatbooks thatmeemwritten about this the algor bookourchoice and thedavid makaibook sustainoble energy without the hot air they really go through itandithink ngreatofaframework that this can be discussedbroadly because we need broadbacking forthis
other's alotathe houseto cometogether so this is awish it's a very concreetwish that
we invent this technology if you gaveme only one wish for the nextfifthyears i canpick whose president i canpickofacceme
which is something i love or icould pick that this thing that's half thecostwithnoseo twogets invented
this is the wish i wouldpick this is theone of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish the division between the people who think shorttermnlong terwill be terrible
between youisandchina between poor countries andrich and most of all the lifes of those twobillions will be far worse so whatdo we have to do what am my appealing atiyude astepforward and
anddrive weneededitogo for war research funding and when countries gettogetherat places like copenhaginteysen
justiscosthesioto they should discuss this inovationofgenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculouslylo levelsuspending
on these inivative approaches we neent doneed the marketincentits seotutaxs capantrades something that gets that pricesignalout there
we needtoget themessage out we needohave this dialogtobe a more rashonalmore understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you
takyod tankyo
thank you ahsitto understand moreabout about terapala right
we'fessowcangive a senseof whatsortof scale ofinvestment this ays
buttotoactually do thissoftwereby the supercompudor hierall thegreat cientists which we'vedone that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out
ina russianryactor to makessure armaterialswork properly then you'll only be upin hundreds ofmillions the tothing is building the pilot reactor
afinding the saverobillion afinding the theregulator thelocation thatwill actaly build first one of these one shouldget the first one built
if it works as advertise thenit'sust clearasday because the economics the energudensity are so different than newclers we know it
andso to understand it right thisinvolves building deep into theground almostlikelike a verticle kndofcolumof nuclierful of thissotospanuraniam andthen andthentand thenthe presces starts at the topandkinof works down
that's right today you're always refuling thereactoracy of lots of people and lots of controls thatcango wrong that thingweya're opening it up and moving things inand out that's
that's not good so if you han't berydvery cheepfuel then you canput sixty years end just think ofitis a log
put it down and not have thosesame complexities and it just sits thereandburns for the sixth years ahand and then it's done
it'sitsanucler paprontais its own wistdisposal solution
yelwodhammens withthewaste you canyou can let it sit there ah there's a lot less waste under this approach ah then you canactuly take that and put it into another one and burn that
and and we start outacty byteaking the waste thatexists today thatsitting in these coolingpools or drycasking by reactors that's our ful
to begin with so the thing that's been problem from those reactors is actually what gets fedindoars and you're educing the volume of the waystquite dramatically as you're going through this process
antyou're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here whereweare is theire most interestin actually doing something with this
well we haven'tahpicked particular place butahand there's all these interesting disclosurerules boutaningthat's called nuklir

what we need for one these

you'vebeen overeating andyou'reabout have a hartattack andonthen then then wheredo you go you may need heardserger something there is a line of research on what's called guangineerian

so i've known lot of fish in my life
i've loved only too
at first one was that
it was more like a passionate affair
it was a beautiful fish

seakifye'll goot about sellingit
i was in relationship with this beauty for several months
one day thehead ofthecompany called and askedif i'd speakout an event
bout the farmsistainability absolutely i said
here's company trying to solve
what's become this unimaginable problem for asheps
how do wekeep fish on our menus
for the past fiftyyears we'vebeen fishing the seas

different kindoflovestory
it's the romantickind
thekind wearethemore you get to know yourfish you'llove thefish
i first aidet at arestarant in southern spain
ajornalistfrand ad been talking about this fish for a longtime
shicanas setus up
itcame to the table abright
almost shimmering whitecolor
the sheff had overcooked itlike twiceoveroka amazingly itwas still delicious
who can make afishtastgood
after it's been overcooked
i can't but thisgican't
let's call himmegale actually his name ismegale
iknow hedidn't cookdthefash andhe's not ashaft at least inthe waythat you and i understand it
he's biologist
atvectalapamma it's a fishfarm in the southwestern corner of spaine
it's at thetip of the guadalicuvir river
until thenineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians
they raised beefcattle amalwas assentially wetlancs
they did it by drainingthland they built this intricate series of canals
and they pushed water offthe landand outinto the river
whilheycouldn't make it work noteconomically
andechologically it was disaster
killed like ninetypercent ofthebirds which forthis place thelottobirds
and so in nineteen eighty two
a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased thelandwhatdid they do
they wereverstheflow of water they literally flippedthe switch
setapushing waterout
they used the channels to pullwater backin they flotted thecanals
they created a twenty seven thousand acrefishforn

completely reversed theechological destruction
the farm's incredible imanyou've never seen anything likethis

it's such a rich system

there is no feed
ever heard of a farm the dozen feet its animals
later that day i was driving round this property with meagalandi asked himaself ora place it seemed so natural
unlike anyfishfor alegantyfarm i'd ever beenat
withow doyou measure success
athat moment it'sasif a filmdirector called for sectchange and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingus
a literal pink carpet forasfar as you could see
that success he said
look at their balleys pink they're feastting
ceasting astallyconfesi saidmegeaenthey fasting on your fish
yes he said
we lose twenty percanofour fish andfish eggs tobirds
iwilllast yearathis property had sixhundred thousand birds onit
more than two hundred fifty different species it's become today the largest
andoneof the most important
private birdsanctuaries in all of europe
i sentomegale isn't athriving birdpopulation like the last thing you want on a fishfarm
heshook his headnowhe said
we farmed extensively
not intensively
this is an echological network
theflumingoes eattheshrimp theshrimpeap thefitoplanan so the pinker thebelly the better the system
lookatslet's review afarmthadozen feetits animals
anda farm that measures itsuccess
on the health of its preditors
a fishfarm butalso a birdsanctuary
ohandby theway those flemingas they shouldn't even be there in the firstplace
they brode in atown a hundredan fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for buildingnests
everymorning they fly one hundred fifty miles into thefarm
and everyevening they fly onehunror fifty milesaback
they do that because they'reable to follow the broken whihte line of highway ninety two
nogetting
nowi was imagining amarchof thepenguins theng youknow so looked at megall isaid
megaldo they fly one hundredand fifty miles to the farm
and then do they fly one hundrad fifty miles back at night
do they do that for thechildren
he lookedatmelike idjustquarter awitmehustan saw
he said no theydoicasthe food's better
i didn't mantion the skin ofmy beloved fish
which was delicious and idon't like fishskin idon't likeitseared i'malikeitcrispy
is that acoridtarlike flavor
imust nevercookwith it
yet wheni tasteditat that restarant in southernspan it tasted not at all like firskin
atasted sweet and clean
like you weretaking a bite of the ocean
i mentiond that tomegalanhe nodded he said the skin ags like spunge last effence before anything enters the body it ivolved
to soakup impurities and then he added
but our water has no impurities
okaafarm the dozen feetits fish
afarm the measuresis success
by the success of its preditors
and then i realize when he says
a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the guatlicofyour river
sariverthat carries with it all thethings therivers tend to carry these days
chemical contammonens pestaside runoff
and when it works its way through the system
and leaves the waterer it's cleaner than whenitenter
the system is so healthy it purifies the water
so notjust affarmthadozen feetitsanimals not justtafarmthameasures thehealth
theyhadsuccess by the health of its preditors
but a farm that's literally all waterapurification plant
and not justfor those fish
but for you and me aswealth because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic
adropinthe ocean i know but i'll take it and so shouldyou
because this love story
however romantic is also instructive
you might say it's aracipy for the future of good food
whetherwere talking about bass or beefcattle
what we need now is aradically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastesgood
butfor alot ofpeople
that's abigtooradical
we'renot realists aspoudes

we love farmer's markets we love small family farms

that'sbeen themotiveation speend the justification it's been the business plaannt
of american agriculture weshullcall itwhat it is
a business andliquidation
abusiness that's quickly aroating ecological capital that makes that very productionpossible
asouht of business andhis agriculture
our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
not by the latest combineandtractor invention but by fertil land
not by pumps but by fresh water
not by chainsaws but by fores and not by fishing boats and nets but by fishin theseak wontofotheworld
let's start by asking howwedoneto feet ourselves

todo that don't look
at the agrabusus model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's highoncapital camistry andmachines

instead let's look to theachological mottle
that's theone that relies on two billion years

everybodytalks about happiness these days
i had somebody counce the number of books with happiness inthe title published inthelast five years
and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
there is a huge wave of interest inhappiness among researches there is a lot of happiness colching everybodywould like to make people happier
but inspite of all this flood of work there are several congtof traps that wouldhavemakeit almost impossible to think straight abouthappiness
and my talk today will be mostly about these conglivetraps thusapplies to laypeople thinkingbof their own happiness anditapplice to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns outwherejust asmesstopas anybody elses
the first of these trapis a reluctance to admitcomplexity turnsiout that the word happiness is justnot a youthful word anymore because we applied to too many different things
i think there is one particular meaning fortowhich we might restrictit but byandlarge thisassomething that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adoptthe more complicated view of what wellbeing is
the secondtrap is a confusion between experienceind memory masecletsbetween being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts andthare bothlump in the notion of happiness
and thethird is it's the focasingilusion andit's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that effects well being without distorting its importance andinthis isa real cogetivetrap thereis just no way of getting itright
now i'd like to start withan example of somebody
wheda question and answerassertion after one of my lectures
reported a story and thatwer the story he said hehad been listening to asinphany
and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added greading quite emotionally
itruined the whole experience
buttetadents
whenit had ruined where the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left withthe memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gottentokeep
when this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves andof otherpeople in terms of twoselves ahthere is an experiencingself
who lives in the present
and knows the present 'scapable of reliving thepast abasiclyithas only the present it's the experiencing selfthat thedoctor approaches you know when the doctor us does itshurt now when ithoughttrue here
and then thereis a rememberingself
and therememberingself is the one that keeps score
and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor
approachers in asking the question
how have you been feeling lately orhowas your triptoorbanio something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self
and and therememberingself and gettingconfused between them is partof amessabout the notion of happiness
now the rememberingself
is a storyteller andthat really starves withabasick
responseof our memories starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we setout to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is astory
andlet me begin with one example
thuses an old study those areactual patients undergoing apainful procedreaon goingto detail it's no longer painfor thesedays but it was painful whinthesixwhen this study was run inthnineteen nineties
therearsthe report of theirpagn everysixty seconds and here are two patients those are theirtheirecordings and whoareasked
whoofthem suffered more and it's a veryeasy question inclearlypatient be suffered more ifs colonoscopy was longer and everam
minute of pain that patient had patient behad and more but now thereis another question
how much didthese patients think they suffered
and here is a surprise
and the surprisis that patient had amuchworse memory of theolonoscopy than patientby the stories of the colonosopies weredifferent
and because a very critical part ofthe storyis how it ends
and neither ofthese stories is very inspiring or great butbut one of them is thisthincbut one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse ifthe one wherepain was letits speak at the very end
it's a bad story howdowe know that because we asked these people after theircolonoscope and much later too howbad was the whole thing intotal and it was much worse for than forbeein memory
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencingself and the rememberingslf from the point of the experiencingself clearly be had worse time
now whatyou could do with patient and weactually ranclynical experiments andit has been done and itdoes work you could actually extend thecolonoskopy of patient by justkeeping thetoubin without drigglingit too much that will
that will cause the patient to suffer budressed alittle and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencingself of patient aworseoff
and you've made the rememberingself of patient alotbetteroff because now you have endowed patient
withabetter story about his experience
whatthetfinds testory
and that is true ofthe stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we makeup wheniterfinds a story archangers significant moments and endings endings are very very important andin this case you know the ending dominate
now the experiencingself lives itslife
continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward
theyare lost forever memost ofthe moments of our lifeand icalculated youknow tho psychological presents is said to be about three seconds longthat means that youknow and inarlife theyareabout six hundred millions of them ina months therareabout sixhundred thousand
most of them don't leave atrace most of them arecompletely ignored by the rememberingself
and yet somehow youget the sense that they should count
that whathappens during these moments of experience isour life
it's the finightresorse that weare spending while weare onthis earth
and how to spendit would seem to be relavant but that is not the story that theu rememberingself keeps for us so we have the
rememberingself and the experiencingself andtheyarereally quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time
from the point of view of the experiencing selfif youhave avication and the second week is drust as good as the first then
the two weekvication is twice as good as the one weekvocation that's not the waytworks at all for the rememberingself for the rememberingself two weekvocation is barely better
than the one weekvocation because theyrareknow memories added you have not trained the story
and in this way time is actually the critical variable the distinguishers rememberingsof from our experiencingsotime has very little impart on the story
now the rememberingself does more than rememberandtell stories itis actually the one that makes decisions
because if you have apatient wohashadsay tocolonoscopies with two different surgions and is deciding which or them tochrose then
the one that cruses the one that has enolthe memory that is less bad and that's the truthothe surgeon that willbe chosen
the experiencingself has no voice in this choice we actually don't chose between experiences wechoose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future
wedon't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories
and basictlyyou can look at the unisatyrany of the rememberingself
and you can think ofthe rememberingsof sort of dragging the experiencing selfto experiences that experiencingself does'meed
i have that sense that when we go onvocations this is very frequently the case thatis that it's
wewe go onvocations to a very large extent in the service of arrememberingself
and this isabithowto druss thefirethigoy
how much weconsume our memories that is one of the explanation that has given for dominance of rememberingself and
wheni thinkabout that i think aboutaflecation we had inintoctic few years ago which was clearly thebestlication ofethehart and i think of it ratherlly often
relative to how much i think of other vacations and
i'dprobably have consumed my memories of that three week tripi would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know ifif i hadeveropened thefalder withthesixhundred pictures init i would have spent another hour
now that is three weeks and that is atmostanhour andahalf
there seems to be discrepency owi maybeabitextreme inoinhow little appetite i have forconsuming memories but even if you do moreofvers
there is agenuine question
why do we put so much weighton memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about athortexperiment
imagining that for yournextlication you know that at the end ofthethevecation all your pictures will be destroyed
and you'll get ananisi drug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vocation
and andif anif you would choose a differentvocation
there is a conflict between your two sells and you need to think about how toadudicate that conflict and it's actually nottat all obvious because if you thinkin terms of time
then you get one answer and if you think interms of ofmemories you might get another answer
why do we bak them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know whitherchoice between the two sells
now the twoselves bring two notions of happiness thererereally two concepts of happiness that we can apply one perself
and so you can ask how happy is experiencingself and then you would ask how happy of the moments intheexperiencing self'slife
and thereare happiness for moments asta fairly complicated process whataretheemotions that can be measured and by the way now weare capable of
getting pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencingself overtime
if you ask for the happiness of the rememberingself it's a completely different thing thatsas not about how happylya person lives itis about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life
very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mesup the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of wellbeing
who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way thethe distinction between the happiness of the experiencingself and the satisfaction of the rememberingself has been recognized in recent years
and thereare now efforts to measure the two separately the galloporganization hasaworldpol with more than half amillion people have been asked questions about whatthey think of their lifeand about
their experiences and ther therehave been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the twocells
and the main lesson i think that we have learned isartheyare really different
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about howhappily thei'r living their life
andviseversa justto giveyou sense ofthe correlation the correlation is aboutpoint fivewith that means as if you met somebodyand you weretoldorhis fatheris sixfeet tall
whow much would you know about this height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if idtell you that somebody
rank their life eight ona scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are withtheir experiencingself
so the correlation is low we know something about what control satisfactionof the happinessself we know that money is very important goldsare veryimportant we know that happiness ismainly
being satisfied with people that we like
spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures butthisisdominent so if you want to maximize the happiness of the twoselvs you are going to endup doing very different things
the bottomline of what said here is that we really should not think of happiness aas a subsitutes for wellbeing it is a completely different notion
now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that
we do not attend thesentto the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people areincalifornia
youare not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier inculifornia if if say you livein ohayo ahand
and what happens is when you thinkabout living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places
and that contrast says inclimate whell it turnsoutthe climate is not very important tothe experiencingself and is not even veryimportant to the reflectiveself that besides how happypeople are
but now because the reflectiveself isincharge
you may endupsome people may endup moving to california andit's sort of interesting to trace whatis going to happen to people who move to californian the hope of getting happier
well their experiencingself is not going to get happier we know that
but one thing will happen they will think theyare happier
because when they think about itthey'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio
and they willfeel they made theright decirsion it is very difficult to think straightabout well being and
i hope i have given you sense of how difficult it is thank you
igivtaioottodi
thankthank you so much now when weare on thefoneamfew weeks ago
you mentioned to me that athere was quitean interesting result came out of that gallop'servey
isthat istitsomny that you canshare since you do have few moments lefnow
short ah i think the most interesting resolv that we found in gallopsofhis isanumber which we absolutely did not expect to find we found out with respect to the happiness of the experiencingselfh
when youno we lookedat how inhorfeelings very withincome
andit turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars ayear for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it's lodrepresentative samplebelow an income of sixhundred thousand dollars aear
ficfiftythousand
sixty fhousandm
sixty thousand sixty thousand dollars ayear people are unhappy and theyyet progressively unhappyofthe poorervigiet above that wegettan absolutely flatline i mean i'vereally seen lyine so flat
clearly whathavs happenedis money does not buy you experientral happiness but lack of money certainly buys your misery
and wecan measure that misery very very clearly in terms of this
the otherselfthe rememberingself you get adifferent story the more money youare the more satisfied yourthat does not hold for emotion
but donivithe unwholeamerican endeavoris about lifelibertyof thepursuit of happiness
if people took seriously that fineding amititseems to tun upside down everything webelieve about
wenimight for example taxationdpolicy and soforthis thereis thereany chance that politicians thatthe country generally would take afinding like that seriously andrunpublic policy based on it
ouknowithink that there is recognition of the roleof happiness resutrin public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the yuke it is happening and in other countries it is happening
people arerecognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of publicpolicy
'sgoing to take awhile andit's not going to and people are going to debate whetherthey want to study experience happinus or whetherthey want to study lifeivaluations o we needto have thatdebatefairly soon howto inhanse happiness
goes very different ways depending andhow youthink onwhether youthink ofthe rememberinguself woryouthink of the experiencingself this is goingto influence policy i thinkinheis to come inthe united states efforts are being made
to measure the experience happiness of thepopulation this is going to be ithink within nextdecadoto part of natonalstatistics
whileiit seems to me thatthis issue welloratleast should be
the most interesting policy discussion to track overthe nextvees thankyou so much for inventing behaviouraeconomics

so thisatrickthat i often teach to young children that are interestedin magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this varyeven thohsea very simpletrick methoologically probably many of you in theroom know this trickawhat happens is this i hold the knife in my hand
i say im going tograbholdof my risk to makesurenothing goes upor down my sleeve thatistalie the reason i'm holding onto my rist is because that's actually the secret
of the illusion in amoment when my handmoves from facing you to being away from you this finger i'dhear my indectsfingers juscanashift from where it is to a position
finding out like this
nicesward
someone who didn't have childhood isouttheres
solidouslike this from here i and as i move around my fingershifsand we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice thereare only three fingers downhere because the mine in the way it processis informationit doesn't count one to threeitgroups them but that's not really what this is aboutright theni open my hand obviously its clinging there not by animal magnetism but by
cicanory innext finger being there and then when i closed my finger thesame thingasi movedback
this motion canhave covers themoving back of myfinger i take this handaway yougive the nifeout there's a trick you can do for your friendsandneighbors anthaks now
whatdes that have to do with the procebleeffect well
i reada study ah a year orso ago that really blue my mind wide open i'm not a doctor researchor so this to me was an astonishing thing
turns out that if you administer aplacebo in the form of a white pill that's like aspranshaped just around whitepillit has some certain measurable effectbut if you change the form that you give theplaceboin like you make a smaller pill and colorit blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective
even though neither one of these things has anyfarmesuitable quitsftheir shugerpills but a whitepill is notas good as a bluepill lillatwhat
that really flitme outturns out though that that's not even where it stops if you arhave capsles
the're more effective than tablets in anyform a colored capistle that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a whitecapstle dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice aday is not as good as three pills
idon't remember thistotisicnansfu but the point is
these dosages have somethingtodowith it and the form has somethingand if you want the ultermate inaplocebo you'go to the needle
right asurrynged with some innertcouple seaseas of someinerts something and you inject this into a patient while this is such a powerful image in their mind thatitis so much stronger than the whitepill as it really thisgraffoawell ilshoitefsome other time when we haveaslides the point is
the whitepill is not as goodas the bluepill is not as goodas thecapstel is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real farmesuticale quality it's only your belief that makes it real
in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously apake trick and make it seem real
and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hatpinit's very very sharp
and going to juststarelize at a tiny bit cay
thisis really my flesh this is not damian's special grownflesh that's my skin rightthere this is nota hollywith special effect i'am going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the otherside
if you're queezy if you're if youfaint easili was doingthis for some friends in hotelroom last nightansomepeople thati didn't knowand one woman almost pastoutso i suggest if you'remeif you'dget queesyeasy thatlookawave forabout the next thirty infact knowaunti'll do the first badpart behindityou'll get to see you can look awaytoo if you like to
ah so here's what happens right hereatthe beginning of my flesh ah at the lower part of my armi just make a little pierce
i'm sorry maaiimiht freeking you out okand then justthrough my skin atiny bit andout the other side like this
now essentially were in the same position we were in with knifetrick
asortof
but you can't count my fingers rightanowacan smethsellme showem toyou that's ane two three for fiveasma
i know what people think whenthey see this they go well hewouldcertainly not dumbenough to stab himself through the skin toentertain us for a few minutes
somygiveyoualittle peak
that lookdout there pettygood
yeino
and thepeople in thebackoocua i didn'treally seehapeople in sadleiteroomor like starting to move in now megiveyou a good closelook at this that really is my skin that is not a hollywoot special effect that's my flesh
andi can twist that around i'm sorry idon'tif you're getting queezy lookaway don't lookathething
peopleintheback ar people onvitioyears rom now watchingtasigo that looksakind of neattand
some sort of effecttherebut if it werereal hewould beseenasta whole there indaholethere if it were real he would be bleeding
ilmework upsome blood for him

normally now i would take the needle outi would cleanofhmy armandi would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of
taking something phakeand making it into something real i'm jut going to leave it there and walk off the stage
i will be seeing you several times ovrthe next few days i hope you're looking forward to that thankyou
if i can leave you with one big idea today it's that the whole of thedata in which we consume is greater than the sum oftheparts and instead of thinking about information overlowed
what i'd likeyou to think about is how we can use information to that pattern'spop and we can see trins that would otherwise be invisible so whatwe're looking at right hereis a typicalimortality chart organized by age this
toolthat i'musing here is a little experimentis called pivetand withpivet what i can do is i can choose tofilteron one particular cause of deathsay accidents and right away i see there's a different pattern that emergeus
this is because inthemiderehere people theirmost activeand overhearether theirmost frail we can stepbackout again and then reorganize the daythat by cause of death
seeing that circulatory diseases andcansers are the usual souspects but not foreveryone if we go aheadand wefillter
by age say forty years or less we see that accidentsareactually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about
andbedrilntothat its especially thecase from that so youget the idea that viewing information doinggatein this way is a lot like
swimming andanliving information andvographic and if wecan do this for rawdata why not do it for contentas well
so what we have righthere is the cover of every single sports illustratit ever produced
it's all here it's allin the web you can go back toyourooms andtry this aftermy talk withpitofit candrill into adeckade you can drill into a particular year you canjumpright into aspecific issue
so i'm looking at this i see the athletes that have appearedin this issue the spords i'm aland'sarmstrong fan so i'llgo aheadandallcook on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lancsarmstrongs beenapartof
now if i wanted just cind take apeakat these i might think well whatabout taking lookat allofcichling so i can stepback and expand on that andisee grugglamannow
andso you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrow broader bcking andbacking out you'renot searching you'r not browsing you're doing something that's actually littlebiddifferent it'sind between an
we think itchanges theway information can be used so i wontoextrapulate on this idea bit with somethingthat's littletecrazy whatwe've done heres we've taken everysingle wiccapetiapage and we reduced it down to littlesomrin so the somery consistof justalittle synobsis andaicontoindicate the topical airia that itcomes from i'm only showing the top five hundred most popularwicapetia pages righthere but even this limited view
we can doalot of thanks rightaway we get a sense of whatarethetopical domansatourmost popularinwicopedia i'm gonto goaheadandsleke government
now having selected government i couldnowsee that the wickapedia catigories that most frequently correspondto that our time magazene people ofthe year
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within anyone wicapetiapage it's only possible to see that endsightwhen you stepbackat lookat all of them looking at one of these particular sumres i can then drill into the consept of
time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them so looking at these feple i cansee that the majority come from government
some have come from natural sciences
some feware still have come from business
there's my bos anda
one come from music
andinterestingly enough bone was also tedprisewinner
so we can go jump and take alook at allatetprise winters so yousee we're navigating the webfor the first time asif it's actually web not from page to page but a higher levelofabstraction
andso i want to show you onenother thing that maycatch littebitby surprise i'm just showing thenewyorktimes weptsit here soipivat this application i don't wantatocall browser's reallynotabrowser
but you can view wedpages with it and we bring that zumable technology to every single wedpage like this so i can stepback
pap right backanto aspecific section now the reason why this is importance because by virtue of justviewing wetpages in this way i can look itin my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill in to what i've done
overspecific time frames here infact istthe state of all the demo that i just gave andicansort of replaysamstuff thati was looking atearlier today
and if i wanto step back and look at everything i can sliceenddice my history perhaps by my searchhistory
hereii's doing some nepatistic searching looking for being overhere foralive lapspivit and from these candrillinto weahasand just launch them again it's one meatowfor
repurposemultibale times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sumoftheparts withthedayadie so
right now in this world we think about datas being this curse we talk about the curse of information overlowed wetalk about
drowninginddada whatif we can actually turn that upside down and turn thewebb upside down
so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next we get usedto the havit of being able to go from manythings to manythings and then being able see the patterns that were otherwise hitant if we can do that then instead
of being tract anddata we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can teaseout knowledge andofweget the knowledge thatthermaybe these rom ther's wisdomtobe found sowthat i thankyou
i grew up onasteadydied ofsides fiction in highschool i took abufto school an hour eachway everyday and was always absorbed in a book
sidesfiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this ahinina inanarrative formthis insatiable sense of curiosity that i hadin and
youknow that curyosity also manifested itself and inthem
the factthatwhenever i wasntin school i was i was out in the woods hikingand taking
samples ahoffrogs and snakes and bugs and pondwater and ringingit back looking atit under micrescopeiwas enalliwas reilledsidesgak butitwas all about trying to understand
understand the world understand thethelimits ofofpossibility and my loveofofciad' fiction
i actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this was the late sixdys
ah youno we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deepotions jakusto was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places inalla wondrous world that we could never really have
previously imagined sothat seem to resinate with the whole sciencefiction partofit
and i was anartist ahi coulddrawlike paintand and ii found that because there weren't inovidiogames andthissaturation of sigimovisan and all ofthis imagery inthe media landscape
i had tocreate these images in my headoutyounon't we all did as kids having to areadabook and through the author's description put something ononthe screanothe movyscreanin our heads and so my
response to this was to paint to draw aliancreatures alian worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting bustedin mathclass inodudling behind the behindthe textbook and
that was creativity had tohad tofind its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened thatthe jacusto
shows ahnatyeugot me veryexcitedabout the facthat there was an alian world right here on earth i might not really go to analian world ahona spaceship someday ahthat that seemed pretty onpretty darnunlikely
but couldthat was a world i could really go to right here on earthat was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined ah from reading these books
so ahi decided i was going become a scubadiver at the age of fifteen andthe only probmwith that was that i lived in a little village in canada sixhundred miles from the nearest ocean
but i didn't let that daunt me ahi pestured my father until he finally found a ascuboclassin inabuffaloo newyork reghtacross the border from where we live
and i actallygot sirdofied inapool atawyemsie in the dead of winter and buffalo new york and
i didn't see the ocean ahareal ocean for another two years until we thougwemoved tocalifornia and nhou since then innintheinthintervening
forty years ah i've i've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was insubmercibles and have learned thatthat
that that deepochand environmentand even theshallowoceans are so rich andwith withamazing life
that really is beyond beyond our imagination nature's imagination is so
so boundless compared to our own a meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what iwhat i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the oceanis
is ongoing and andjust as strong as it everwas butaiweniwheni choseacreeras anadult
it was fillmaking and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
this urge i had to tell stories with my myurges tooatradeemages andi was as a kid constantly drawin comic booksandson so fillmaking was the way to put put pictures and stories together and thatmade senseand of course thestories that
i chose to tell wheresinsfixtion stories terminator alians then the abyss and with the abyss ahii was putting together my love of underwater anddiving with filmmaking soapyo
merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was
that tosolveaspecific narrative problem on that felm which was to create this kind of liquidwater creature
ah we actually embraced a computor generated animation asigi and
this athis resulted in thefirst soft surface character seegianimation that was ever ina inamoving
and even though shelntinmake money barelybroke even i should say i witness something amazing which is that the theaudience the globalaudience was mesmorized by this apparent magic inoits arthur clark's law that any sufficiently advanced technologyas indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical
and so thatthatgatgot me very excited thought wow this is this is somethingitneeds to be embraced into thesynematic artso with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther workingwith withialemwe created the liquidmetal
dued in that filmenthatesuccess hunginthe balanceon whether thateffect would workandit did andwe created magic againandwe had the same result ahwith an audience altoughwe didn make a little more money on that ahso
now draygaline through thosetthose twotwodots ofecof experience came to testhis is gon to be a wholenewworld this is a whole new world of creativity for
forfilm artists so i startedtacompany with stamwenston my good friendstamwinston whois a thepremior makeupanencreature designer
ahat that time andit was callediginal domain and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrogpaths the kind of analoguprocesses of ofopticle printersinsoon we would go right to diginal productionand we actualydid thatanitgave us a competitive advantage for awhile
but we found ourselves lagging in thinthemidnightes in the creatureand character designstuff that wehadactually founded the company to do
so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
of visual effects of sige effects beyond withrealistic human inmotive ah characters generated insg in the main characters of obiansgi and the world would beinsige and
theemvelope pushed back and i was told by ahathe folksat my company that we weren't gonto beableto do this for a while so i shelvedit and i made this othermovy about big shipthat sinks
and i went andpitchit to thestudio as romio and juliet onashipatskunobe this epic romance passionate
thefilm secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real reck ofatitanicand that's whyimade the move
andthat's the true nowstudio didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we'regonta diveto the reckworenta fillment forreal willbeusing it in the opening of the film allbe really importataby a great marketing hookandi talkedthem into funding and expedition
sounds crazy but this goes back tothat themeabout youknow your imagination creating areality whoseractal cratedareality whereasixmonths later i found myself ina russian submercibul
two and half miles downinthenorth atlantic looking at therealtitanic through throughavuport natamouvi notachde forreal
now that that blomy mind and youknowitook a lot of preparation we had to build cammers and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this
dive these deepdives was like likea spacemission you know whereitwas itwas highly technacle and a required enormous planningand you getin this capsil you go downto this dark hostile a environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself
and yeno i'vethought well i'mi'mlike living in a science fictionmovy this is really cool
and so iireally got bitten by the bug of deepocean explaration ofcourse the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventureit was curiosityitwas imagination andit was inexperience
that hollywood couldn't give me cause youknow i could imagine creature and wecouldcreate visual effectfor it but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions
i was seeingcreatures at hydrythernal vancs and and sometimes things thati hadhadnever seen before sometimes things that noone had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imagedthem so i was completely smittendby this
and had to do more and so i actually made a conacurious decision after the successof titanic i saidocainomona parkmy dayjob as a hollywood moovinmaker andimgoingto gotbe afulltime explorer for awhile
and so younonwe started planning these these expeditions and wewanedupgoing to the bismarkand and exploring it with with robatic vehicles we went back to thetitanic rickwetook little bots that we had created thisspooldo fibroptic
and hathe idea was to go inindo an interior survey of that shipah which had never been done nobody ever looked inside directedidn't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it
to know here i am now onthe deck of titanic sitting in a submerciful and looking out at planks that looked much like this where i knew that the thattheband had played
andi'm flying a little robatic vehicle through thethrough thecorridor ofthof the ship youknowheni say know i'mi'mi'moperating itbut my mind is in the vehicle
i felt like i was physically present inside theshipreck of titanic andit was the most serenal canadejavou experience ii'veever had because
i would know before i turned corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked theset fror months when we were making the movy
and thesetwas based as an exact replica on theblueprints of the shipso therwas this absoltly remarkable experienceatit really
made me realize that youltellthe tellapresents experience that you actually canhave these robotic abatars then your consciousness
is is ininjected intothe intothe vehicle intothisthiother form of existenceand was really really quite profound and maybe littlebit of a glimpse toto whatmight be happeningeosome decades out as a
as we start to have sideborg bodies for explorationor forother means and inmany sort of ahposthuman futures thatthat i can imagine as a sciencefixingpam so having done these thesezap
ah expeditions ahandand inareally beginning to appreciate what was downthere such as at the at the thedeepoceanvence where we had these
amazing amazing animals the'rebaybasie alians right here on earth they live inaanenvironment of kemosynthesis they don't survive
ontsunlight basedsystem theway we do and so you're seeing animals that areliving next toafive hundred degree senigrade waterplums thatyou think they can't possibly exist at the same time
i was getting very interested in space cience well again the sciencefiction influence as kid
and i wond up getting involved with ha the spacecommunity really involved with tha with nassa sittig on thenassadvisry board planning a actual spacemissions going to russia going through the precosmanat biometical proticals and all these sorts of things
to actually go and fly to theinternational spacestation with our threedecamaus systems and this was fascinating but whatwhati wondupdoing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep
and taking them downsothatthey had access astorbiologists planetary scientist people who ware interested in these extreme offile invironments
takingthem downtothevents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and soanso herewe were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing spacesides
ihad completely closed the loop between being the scientfiction fan inoas kid and doing this stuff for real
and inalongtheway thainthis journey of discovery i learned alot i learned alot about science but i also learned lot about
leadership ow you think director's gotobea leader leaderofcaptain theship alltat's hurthing inerally learndabout leadership until
i did these expeditions because i hadtoat certain pointssay what am i doingouthere why am i doing this watdo i get out ofit
wedon't make money at these damshows ounowebarly break even here'sno fameinit people sortof think i went away between titanicand avatarandwas buffing my nails someplaceuno sitting outthe beach made all these films made all these documentary films thatyoun'tforvery
limited audienstono fame no glory no munny whatare you doing you're doing it for the task itself for the challenge
and the ocean is the most challenging invironment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens
when a small group of people formatightly niptim ase we would do these things with ten twelvepeople working for years at atime
sometimes atseafor for for twoorthree months atta time andin that bond you realized that the most important thing
is the respect that you have for them thatthey have for you that youh've done task
that you can't explain to someone else when come back to thashoreandyou say wenowwe had to do this and thefibaropticin attenuationand thisandthat allthe all thetechnology of itandthedifficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea
you can't explain itto people it's that thing thatthat maybe copshaveor people inincombat that have gone through something together andthey know they can never explainit createsabondceats abondof respect so when i came back to make my nextmovy which was abatar
i tried to apply that same principale of leadership which is thatyou respect your team and you arein their respectin return andiitreally changed hedinamic so herei was again witha smallteam
and youknow inuncharted territory doing abatar coming up with new technology that didn't exist before tremendously exciting ah tremendously challenging and we became afamily
overafourandhalf year periodacompletely changedhowi doamovy so people of commentatonhow you broughtback the ochianaorganisms and put them on theplanitapandoor to me it was more ofafundamental way of doing business the process itself the changedas a resultofthat
so what canwe sent thesize out of all this you know what's whatorthelessons learn well ithinknumber one is curiosity it's the most powerful thing you owne imagination
is afforce that can actually manifest areality and the respect of your team is more important than all the lorals in the world
andi have young fillmikers
come up to me and sayfyunlgive me some advice for doing this
andi say
don't put limitations on yourself other peoplewill do that for you don't do it to yourself don't bet against yourself and and take risks aanasahasthis hasthis phraise that they like failure is not anoptian
but failure has tobe anoption inart andanexplaration because it's aleap of faith and no important endeavour that required inovation
was done without risk youhave tobe willing to take those risks so that's the thought i would leave you with isitin whatever you're doing failure
is anoptor but fear is not thanyour
i'mgamdongl i'magame designer andi'vebeen making games on thine now for ten years and amy gold for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the worldin online games
now i have plan for this and it intales convincing more people including allofyou to spend more time
playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours aweek playing onlinegames some of you might be thinking
that's alot of time tospend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have tosolve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future ait'sactually theopposite its true
three billion hours aweek is not nearly enough gameplay to solve the world's most urgent problems aminfact
i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically ihave calculated the total we need at twentyone billion hours of gameplay everyweek
so that'staprobably bit of accounterintoitive idea so i'll just i'llsayitagain let it sink in anif we wantus all problems like hunger poverty climatchange globalconflict obecity
i believe that we need to aspire to playgaims allmine for at least twenty one billion hours aweek by the end ofthenextdecade
no i'm serious
i am hereis why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly
this is a portrait by phetographer namephiltoldano he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so he setup acamerin front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic
gaming emotion now ahif you're not agamer you might miss some of the new aunts inthis photo youprobably the senseof urginsee a little bit of
fear but intense concentration deepdeepfocus ontackling a really difficult problem amif you are gamer youwill notice a few newaunces here the crinkle ofthe eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprise thisis a gamer whos on the verge of something called anepyc win nowan
youheard of that okagoodsadwe have some gavers amongit so an epicwin is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no ideaatwas even possible until you achieved itahit was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
and when you get there you're shocked to discover whatyou'retruly capable that'sanepiquint
this is a gameron the verge of an epicwinand this is the face that we need to see on millions of problemsolvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone
who against all odds is on the verge of anepic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everydaylife now as we try totackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'mnotgood atlife face andthas actually
makingit can you see it yes good thisseculy meamaking thati'm not goodatlifeface amthisis a piece of grefety in my old neighborhood indbirkly california whereidid mypeachdee on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem thatalot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just goodasinsuccessful althoughthat's part of it we do achievemore in gameworlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to colabrate and tocooperate andwhen we're ingameworlds
believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves thoug most likely to help ata moment's notice thoug most likely to stickwothta problem as long as it takes toget up after failure and try again amand inareal life
when wewhen we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious maybe depressed frustrated or cynical
we never have those feelings onwereplaying games they justdonexisting games so that's what i wanted to study when i wasagritoas sudant what abouttgames makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we
take those feelings from games and apply them to realworldwork soi looked at games like worldof warcraft which is really the ideal collaboratave problemsoving environment and i started to notice a few things that make
epicwinds so possible and allmine worlds so the firstthing is whenever you show up in oneofthealmine games especially inworldofworcraft there are lots and lots of differentcharacters who are willing to trust you witha worldsaving mission
right away but notjustanymission is amission that is perfectly matched with your current level inthe game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge thatyou can't achieve
but it is onthe theverge of what ou're capable ofso you have to try heard but there's no unemployment inworld of warcraft there's no sitting around ringing your hands is always something specific
and important tobe done andtheyeare also tuns of claborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people
ready to work with you to achieve your epicmission as not something we have inareal life that easily the sunset atour fingertips aure tons of colaborators and also there'sis epic' storythis inspiring storyofwhy werethere
and whatwe're doing and thenwe get all this positive feebackyugies aveherdof leveling up and plus ones stranthand plus onc'sintelligence ollwe don't get that kind of constant feebackinreal life wheniget offthe stage i'm nokginto have you know plusones speaking adplusone
crazy idea aplustwiny crazy idea ahi don't get that feeback inreallife ahnow the problemwith collaborative anmineovarments like world of warcrowd
isthat it's so satisfying to be on the virge of anepiguinall thetime that we decide to spend aller time inthese gameworlds is just better than reality so so far amcollectively all the world of workhafgeamers have spent fivepoint nine three million years solving thevirtual problems of azeroth now
that's notnecessarily abadthirg it might soundlike it'sabadthing but to put that incontext fivepoint nine three million years ago was when
our earliest primatehuman ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate okey so when we talkdabout how much time frecurnlyinvesting andplaying games
the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at themagnitude of human evolution ahwhich isan extraordinary thing but it's also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games were actually changing
whatweare capable of as human beings wereitevolving to be more collavorative and hearty species this is truei believeist so consider this really interesting startistic
iwas recently published byarecetrat carnigimelin university the average young person today in a country witha strong gamer culture
will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours isa really interesting number for two reasons first of all
for children in theunited states ten thousandandeighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifthgreate to highschool graduation if you have perfect attendance
so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a goodgamer as heu're learningabout everything else in school
ansomeof youhave probably read malchamgladwell's newbook outlirs so you would haveheard of his theory of success ten thousand hours theory of success its based on this greatcoginof sciences research that if we can master
ten thousand hours of effortfullstudy atanything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuososatit we'll be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world amand so
now what were looking at is anentire generation of young people whoare virtueosogamers so the big question is
what exactly our gamers getting so goodat because if we could figure thatout we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
this is how many people wehnow have in the world who spend atleast an houraday playing onlinegames these are our virtuosof gamers five hundredmillion people who are extrardinarly good something
andin nextdecade weregantohave another billion gamers who areextrerarlly good
atwhatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming game industry isdeveloping consels thatare lowenergy and that work with thewireless fomenetworks instead of a broadband innernetso that gameris all over the world particularly an india
china brizille canget on line they expectoone billion moregamers inthenext decadeso bingusuptoone point fivebillion gamers
so i'vestarted to think about what these games are making usovirtuousasat here the fourthings i came upwith
the first is urgent optimism canyuthink of this is extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle in obstacle combined withthe belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
gamers always believe that an epicine is possible andthais always worth trying and trying now gamerson'tsitaround
caegamers are virtuosos atweaving a tightsocial fabric is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play agame with them even if they beaten us badly
thereason is it takes a lot of trust to playagamewith someone we trustthat they will spend their time with us thatheywill play by the same rules value the same gole they'll stay with thegame until it's over and so playing agame together actually builds up bonds andtrusts andcooperation amandandwe actually build stronger social relationships asthe result
blissful productivity i love it norteresta reason why the average world of woarcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game theywereactually happier working hard then we are
relaxing or hanging out we know that weare optamizedas human beings to do hardameaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time ifthe'regiven theright work finally epic meaning
gamors love to be attached to all inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories sojust one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective a'mso youallknow wickypetia
biggest wicky in the world second biggest wicky in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of worcraft wicky
five million people useit everymonth they have compiled more information about world of warcraft onthe innernetthan any other topic coveredon any other wickyin the world they are building an epic story they are building anepicknowledge resource about the world of warcraft ocaseo these are four superpowers thatad up
to one thing gamers are superimpowered hopeful individuals
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and theonly problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds andnot the real world that's theproblem that iam trying to salv
ahtheresaneconmis indedwardcastronova whose work is brilliant he looks at why people areinvesting so much time and energy and money in awnline worlds
and he says we're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exidis to virtualwirls andawnline game environments andhe'san economist so he's rational and he says
tatlikemeemmagame desinear unexuberant but he says he says
that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in allmine world than they can in real life theycan have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feeback and feel more rewarded in gamesthan they do in real life so he says
for now it makes perfect sense for gamers tospend more time invirtual worlds than the real world now
i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to starpmaking the real world walk morelike agame so i take my inspiration from something that happened
twenty five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheepsnuckles right before we had asomgame controllers we had sheepsnuckles andathese representsthe first game equipment designed by human beings
andif your familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian heroditus you might know this history ahwhich is the history of who invented games and why
herodato says that games particular dicegames were invented in thekingdom of lidia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine
that king of litia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution
so according toroditis they invented dicegames and they set up a kingdomwide policy
on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and theywould be so emerced in playing thedicegames because games are so engaging and amerceus in such satisfying blissful prodactivity
they would ignore the facthat they had no food to eat and then on thenext day theywould play games and on the next day they would eat and according to heroditis
they passed eighteen years this way surviving throughafamine by eating onmonday and playing games onthenext now this is exactly i think howware yusing games today
we're using games to escape real world's suffering we'reusing games to get away from everything that's broken inthe real environment everything that's not satisfying about real life
and we'regetting what we need from games but it doesn't have to end there this is really exciting according to heroditus after eighteen years the famine wasin getting better so the king decided they would play one final thicegame
they divided the entire kingdom and half they played one dicegame and thewinners of that game got to go
onanepic adventure they would leave lidia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind justenough people
to survive ontheresources that were available and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they couldthrive now this soundslacrazy right
but recently dianeevidence has shown that the atruskins who then led to the roman empire actually share the same diane as ancient lydiants and so
reacently scientists have suggested that heroditus's crazy story is actually true andgeologistshave found evidence of a globalcooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could haveexplained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might havactually
saved their culture by playing games escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and and knew so much about how to cometogether with games thatheyactually saved the entire civilization that way ohetwecan do that
we have been playing warcraft since nineteen ninety four thatwas the first real timeshrategy game from the world oworhalfseries that was sixteen years ago
theyplayddyesgames for eighteen years we've beenplaying workhalf for sixteen years i say weareready forourown epicgame now
they had half thecivilization go off in search of a newworld so that's wherei get my twenty one billion hours a week of gameplay
from let's get half of us too agree to spend an houraday playinggames until we sovereailworld problems now know youareasking
howare weginthsalruo problemsand games well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at theinstitute for the future
we havethis banner in our offices andpaloalto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate the future we do not want to try to predicttothefuture but we wanto to ismake the future
we want to imagine the best caseanarrio outcome andthen we want impowerpeople to make that outcome areality we want to imagine epicwinds and then give people the means to achieve the epicwin
i'm justgon to very briefly show you three games that i've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epiquines in their own futures
so this is wirled without oil we madethis gameintwo thousand seven this is an awnline game in which you try to survive an oil'sshortage
the oilshordage is fictional but we put enough online content outthere for you tobelieve thatit's real and to live your real life as if we'verunout of oil so when you come to the game
you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time newsvitios datdofeeds that show you exactly how much oilcoss what'snot available how foodsupplies being affected how transportations being affected anif schools are closhedif there's riding and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blocg about it
topostvidios topostophotoes we'vepiloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand seven and we've tracked them for thethree years since and i can tell you that thisis a transformitof experience nobody wants to change how they live just because
it's good for the world or because resposedto but if you immersem inanepicadventure and tell them
weverun out of oil this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up therhabits they learninthescame
so for thenext wirldsavinggame we decided toamhigher bigger problem than justtpeak oil ahwe didagame called superstocat the institute for the future
and thepremisewas a supercomputor has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planetthe suprecomputor was called theglobal extinction awarenes system of course nwe askd people to come online almost like jerrybruckhamer moovy
ouknow jerry buckhimeremovies youform a dreamteam you've got theashrnot thescientist exconvict andthey all have something to do to save the world
but inour game insad of just having five people on the dreamteam wesaid everybody's onthe dreamteam andit'syurjob
to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safetynet
wehad eightthousand people play that game for eight weeks that came upwith five hundred insainly creadive solutions that you can go online if yougougl superstuctancy
so finally thelastgame were launching at marchthird this is a game done withthe wirlbank institute if you complete the game you will be
curtified by the worlbank institute as asocial enevator classof two thousand ten working with universities all over subseharein africa and weare inviting them to learn social enevation skills we'vegot agraffic novel
we've got leveling up in skills like local incight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness i would like tonbit allofyou to please share thisgame with young people anywhere in the world particularly indeveloping airias who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
somgentawrap upnow i whentoask a question what do you think happens nextwe've gotallthese amazing gamers we've got these games thatarekind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved therealworld yet
well i hope thatyou will agree with me that gamors are a human resource that we can use
to do realworldwork that games aureapowerful platform for change wehave all these amazing superpowers blissful productivity theability toweave atight social faboric this feeling of urgent optimism and thedesire for ephic meaning i really hope that we can come together
to play gamestat matter to survive on this planet for another century and that's my hope that youwill join me in making and playing games like this wheni look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure
that we canmake any future wecan imagine and we can play any games we want so i say let the worldchanging games begin thank you
efpretenright here we have machine a big machine a cooltetish machine and it's a time machine in everyone in this roomhas toget into it and you can go backwards youcan go forwards you cannot stay where you are
andi wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friendsthisquestion alot lately and they all want to go back idontnotemonto go back before there were autimobeles or twitter or american idle
idon'know i'mi'm convinced that there'somesort of pulltonastaga to wishfulthinking and i understand that that part of that crowd i have to say
idon wanto go back andit's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back theygo forward so i want togetin machine and i wanto go forward
this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth
mobility opportunity declining raites of disease there's never been atime like this my greatgrandparents
died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents are closing ananady soaa
ther'd better beatheredbetter be anine in the beginning of my deathnumber ahbutit'snatit inabout people like us because
this is a bigger deal than that a kitborninnedelly today canexpect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago
tothinkabout that it's anincredible factand whyisit true
smallpocks mapoxkilled billions of people onthis planat itreshaped the demography of the globe and away that no warever has it's gone
it's vanished we'vevanquished it poof in the rich world
diseases that threatened millions of us just ageneration ago no longer existhardly dipthuria rubella poliodoes anyoneeven knowhat those things are
thatseems modern medichine aureability tofeedbillians of people those are triumphs of the scientific methodandto my mind the scientific method trying stuffout
seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the greataccomplishments of humanity sothat's the good news
unfortunately that's all thegoodnens because theresome other problems and they'vebeen mentioned many times and one of them is that
despite allour accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world
everyday backnumbers risingandits rising eally rapidly andits disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination
to thoroughly trash this globe potablewater arrable land rainforests oil gaspthey're going away
andthey're going away soon and unless weinevate our way out of this mass we're going away too
so the questionis can we do that and i i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food there will feed millions of people without wraping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it
i really do believethat and no it ain't wishforthinking but hereis thething that keeps me up adnight oneofthethings that keeps me up atnight
we've never needed progressin science more than we need it right now never and we've also never beenin apositionto deployit properly in the way that we can today we'reon theverge of amazing amazing avents in manyfields
and yet i actually think we'd to go back hundreds three hundredyears before the enlightenment to find atime when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously ononmoreafrench
than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them fruit and listen
everyone's entitled totheir opinion they'reven entitled to their opinion about progress but you knowayu'renot entitled to you'renot entitled to your own facts sorry you'renot andthis took me awhile to figure out
about adecateago i wrote a story about bhatscenes for the new yorker a little storyandi was amazed tofind opposition opposition to what is after all themost effectof public halthmeasure in human history
i'dnnowat to do so ijust did what do iwrote storyandi moved on anamsoon after that
i wrote story aboutgenetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so
i wrote story about that too and i couldn'tunderstand why people thoughthis was franken fouids why they thought mooving lawlkils aroundinaspecific rather than a halfhazardway was trestpassing on nature's ground
but youknow i do watido i wrote the storyi movedon i mean onajournalist
wetitwefilwe go to dinner it's fun
but these stories bothermeandi couldn't figure outwhyaneventually i did and that's because ofthose fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decentpeople
they were exactly likethepeople in this room
andatitjust disturbed me so much but then i thought youknow let's be honest we'reat a point in this world
where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we usedto we talk about it ambivalently wetalk about it in ironic terms with little quoats arounditprogress
okay there are reasons for that and i think we know withthose reasonsare we've lost faith ininstitutions inauthority and sometimes in science itself and therethathere's no reason we shouldnof you can just say afew names and people wil understand
turnoble bopaul the challenger
vyachs weapons of massdestruction hanging chads
i meantyou know you can choose your list
there are questions and problems whath the people we used to believe were always rightso be skeptacal
ask questions demandproof demand evidence don't take anything forgranted but here's the thing when you' get proof
you needtoaccept theproof and we're notthut good at doing that
and the reason that i can say that is because we're now inanapademic of fear like one that i've never seen in hopednever to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story
that linked the epodemic of autism tothe measles monthsandrebella vaxinshot
very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tongus ofstaudies should avebedoneitsan asserious issue
the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweeden from canada anditwas all the same no correlation no connection none atall
doesn't matter itdoesn't matter because we believe annecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
we don't believe a bunch of documents from a governmentofficial giving us data andiido understand that ithink we all do but you know what
the result ofthat has been disastrous disastrous because herestafact
the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaxcinerate formusels is going down
that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible
andwhatkind whatkind of thing happened thetwe could do that now
i understand it i do understanditbecause vutheanyone have musels here tos one personin this audience ever see someonedyeof musles
doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this countryatalbut it happened a hundredad sixty thousand times in the worldlast year that's alottod death of measlstwentyan hour
but since it didn'thappen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jenemacarthy
can go around preaching messages of fear andaliteracy from platforms like opra andlarrykinglive
andtheycan do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem thesame butherealmost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon
thiskywas a hero johnassawhe took one of the worst skurges of mankind away from us no fear noagony poliopofgone

whenpa speaksinatpublic hearing he can't testify withoutarmed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell themthat they remember where his kids go to school
and why because paw made avackscene i non't to saythis but vaxins are essential you take them away diseasecomes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have musles in this country now
andit's getting worse and pretty soon kidsargintadie gun because it's just anumber'sgane andthenotjusgin dieof meesles whatabout polio let's have that

please don't tell me thereareno consequences to these things there are there always are now
the motmineless apodomic were in the middle of righnowas thisabsurd battle between
proponents ofgennetically engineered food and the organicaleth it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's adebate about words about metiphores

there wasn't any cannelope
there were christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years
and some ofit worked and some of it didn't we got ridof thestuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and thererisks
absolutely but we can put somethinglike vitaman into rice and thatstoffcan help millions of people millions of people prolongedtheir lodge
youdontwanto do that i have to say i don't understand it we object to gunetically engineered food why do we do that whilthethings i constantly here are
too many chamicales pastacides hormoanes
minarculture we don't want giantfields of the same thing it's
we don't want company's patening lifes we don't want company's owning seedsand you knowimyresponse to all that is yes
you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge foodproblem that this isn't science
this has nothing to do withscience its law its moralityit's patnstuff no science isn'tacompany it's not a country
it's not even an ideal it's aprocess
it's aprocess and sometimes it works and sometimes itdoesn's but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid
is really very deadening ind its preventing millions of people from prospering youknow in the next
fifty years wereginto have to grow seventy percent more food than we do rightnow seventy percent this istinvestment in africa overlast thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they needit and we're not givingit to them and why
tenetically engineered food we don't want to encouragepeople to eat that rottinstuff like cosava for instance cosavas somethingthat halthabillion people leatit's kinlike potato it's justabunch of callaries it'ssuks
it doesn'thave newtrians it doesn'tave proachintan sciencistsor engineering allof that into it right now
and then people would be able to eatenandtheyd be able notgoblind ifthey wouldn't starveandyou knowwhat thatwuld be nice wouldn't beshapepenice but it would be nice
and all i can say about this is
whyareweefighting itwhy let's ask ourselfs whyrewe funnyit because we don't want to move geanes orothisusabout moving junsaroundit's notabout camicales
it's notabout our ridiculous passion for hormomens our insistents on having biggor food better food singular food
this isn'taboutrice chrispies thir's about keeping people alive andit's about time we'estarted to understand whatthat meant because you know something if we don't
if we continued to actthe way we're acting we're guilty of something that i don't think we want to beguilty of hightatironialism there's no other way to describe what's going onhere it'sselfish
it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it
so after this amazingly fund conversation
itmight wantasaty soyouassoin this ridiculous time machineandgo forward
andabsolutely absolutely i do it'struckin the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we canset that time machine on any thing we want we can move it where we wanttomoveit
and we're guntomoveit where we wanto moveit we have to have theseconversations and we have to think but when we get inthetime machine and we go ahead
we'reginto be happy we do i know that we can andasfar as i'm concerned
that's something the world needs rightnow


one day lossanjelistimes callmisstivlopas was walking along the streets of downtownlasanjelus when he heard
beautiful music and thesource was aman
an african american man charming rugged homeless playing a violend that only had two strings
i'm telling a story that many of you know because steev's columns became the basis for a book which was turned into amoovy
with robert downiy junior acting astivolopas and jamie foxsays nethaniel anthony ars the juliard traineddouble basist whose promising career was cut short
by a tragic affliction with paranide skitzophrenia
nethanel dropped out of juliard he suffered complete breakdown and thirtyyears later he was living homeless on the streets of skidro indontonlasantelis i encourage allof you to read steave'sbook or to watch the movyto understand not only the beautiful bond
that form between these two men but how music helpd shaped that bond and ultimately was instrumental if you'llpardon the pund in helping thethaniel get off the streets
i meat mister ars in two thousand eighttwo years ago at waldisnyconcerthall he had just heardof performance of batoven's first and fourth symphanies and came backstageand introduced himself when speaking inta very joviald and gregariousway about yoyoma andhehillery clentonand how the dodgers were nevergontomake the world series all because of the treacherous first violent passagework in the last movement of batoven's fourth symphony
andwe got talking about music and i got an emale from stevea few days later saying that nethanal was interested in a violinlesson with me now i should mention that nethanel refuses treatment
because when he was treated it was with shocktherapy and thorozin and handcufs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
but as a result now heis proneto theseskitzophrenic appesodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as himexploding
and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skidrowe exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
andnethaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at waltesnyconcert hal he had akind of mannic glint in his eyes he was lost
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke andhow someone was poisoning him in his sleep and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraidthat i wastontoluse him that he was goingto sinkinto one of his states
and thati would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales andarpegyois indother exciting forms of didactic violinpetigoti
so i just startedplaying
andi played the first movement ofthebatoinvylincan churte and as i played i understoodthat there was a profound change occurring innethaniel's eyes
itwas as if he was in the gripof some invisible farmassuiticle achemical reaction for which my playing the music
was its cattlist and thephaniel's manic rage
was transformed into understanding a quietcuriosity anengrace
and in amiracle he lifted his own violen andhe started playing by ear certain snippitsofviolent oncertos which he then askdmeto complete mendleson chicovski sibelyos
andwestarted talking about music from bath to basovenand broms brooknearthe allthe bees from barttok all the way upto esopecasalenan and i understoodthat he not only had anincychlapitic knowledge of music
but he related to this music at personal level he spoke aboutit withta kind of passion and understanding that i share with my coleigues inthelosangulis ilimonic
and through playing music and talking about music this manhad transformed
from the paronoid disturbed manthathadjust come from walkingthe streets of downtamasangelis tothe charming
eiryoudyat brilliant juliartraine musician music is medicine
music changes us and fornethanial music issanity because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality
and that is an escape from his tormented state
and i understoodthat this was the very escence of art thiswas the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental cor our emotions
and through our artistic lens throughour creativity we're able to shape those emotions into reality
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us inspires and unites us
and for nethaniel music brought him back into afold of friends
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him
and i will always make music withnethaniel whetherwearat waltisineconcert hall or on skidrow because he reminds me why i became amusician thank you

evergopo
placeoithati shamelessly stol from cealossoplease forgive
several years ago here atted peter skillman introduced a designe challenge called the marshmellow challenge and the ideas pretty simple teams of for have to build tallest freestanding structureoutof twentysticksof spegetty one yard of tape oneyard of string and marshmellow the marshmella has to beon top and thoughit seems really simple it'sactually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
and so i thoughthis was an interesting idea and incorperateit into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then i've
conductedabout seventy designe workshops across the world withstudents and designers ind architects even the setios of the fortune fifty and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i like to share some of them with you so
normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figareout whatisgonto looklike they jocky for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketching they layoutsfigetti ahthey'dspend themajority of their time assembling the sticks into evergrowing structures and then
finally just as they're running out of time someone takes out the marshmellow and then they ginjerly put it on top and they standback
and cuto
they admire their work but what really happens most the timeis that thedtada turns into an oh because the weight of the marshmellow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so
there are number of people whodhavealot more omoments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
they lie thatacheepthey getdistracted theyveand they produced reallylamedstructures and of course thereis theams that have lot more tadastructures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarden
an
it's prettyamasing as peter tells us not onlydodo they produce the tallest structures butththemost interesting structures of them all so the question you won'toask is howl come
why what isit about them and peter likes to say that none ofthusnone ofthekids spend any time tryingto besiovspegaty ink
rightthey don't tieitspend time jocking for par but ther's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan
right and then they execute on it andthen what happensas when they put the marshmelloontop they runout of time and whathappens it's acrisis
found familiar right rokhewut kindergardeners do differently is that they start with the marshmellowand they build prototype successive protetypes
always keeping themarthnello andtopsothey havemultipal times adtotofix intebildprotetypes alongthe waysothesiners recognized this type of calaboration
as the essence of the iterative process and witheach versin kids get instant feeback about what works and what doesn't work
so the capacity to play in protetypeis is really essential but let's look athow different teams perform
so the average for most people is around twenty inches businesscoolstudents about half of that lawyers lttle better but not much better than that kindergardens better thanmostadelts who does the very best
architects and engineers thankfully and
thirty nine inches the talleststructure a i've seen and why isit because they understand triangles and selfreenforcing geometrical patterns or the key tobuilding selfareenforceor thesestable structures
so iseios little bit better than average but here'sweregets interesting if you put in executive admen on the team theyget significantly better
credible now
look around yougo outtthatteams gnoinedottal beforehand and whyisthat becausethey have special skills of facilitation they manage the processthey understand therprocess and anyteam who manages and pays aclose attention to towork
ah will significantly imimprove theteam's performance specialieskilles and facilitation skilles at the combination leads toito strong success
youhave tenteamsatipically performed you'lget mayby six or sothati've standing structures andaiitried something interesting i thought let's
up theanti once so i offered ten thousand dollar prize of softwarto the winning team so whatdoyou think happened these designed students whatwas the result
here's would happenthere
not one team had a standing structure not one had aif anyonehad biltsay oneinstructure theydntakenomhe theprize so isn'tan interesting that high stakes have strong impact we did theexercise again with the same students whatdyouthink happened then so now the understand thevalue of prodetyping
so thetsameteam went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produce thetallest structures in the least amounta time so there'sadeep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time rnningamarshanello a challenge and the reasonis iohelpcratviginal tooles and processes toahelpatamsbuild cars andvidiogames andvisualeffects a

every project has its own marshmellow desnet challenge providesashered experience acommn language a commonstance to build the right protetype and so thisis the value of the experience of this so simple exerciseand those of youhare interested may wendergo to marshamello challenge dodcommageablog that you can lookat how to build athemarshmellows ar stepdby stepinstructions on this athere are
crazy examples from aroundte world of how people tweakand adjustthesystem there'saworld records that areon this as well
and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport ah it demands that we bring all of our senses to the tastand that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have athand and sometimes a little protetypeof thesexperience is all that it takes to turn us from andomoment to a tadammoment and that can make a big difference thankyouverymuch
