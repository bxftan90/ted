AimeeMullins_2009P_0002.wav: i had already finished editing the pieace and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry

AimeeMullins_2009P_0011.wav: d
AimeeMullins_2009P_0012.wav: i was reading this liss out loud to a friend and atferst was laughing it was so ludicrous but ihad just gotten pasd mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P_0013.wav: when my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P_0014.wav: 
AimeeMullins_2009P_0015.wav: ah an an impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P_0016.wav: noan i'm of course is is my raggedy old vesaris i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date rihte but in fact e printit was the early nineteen eaighties
AimeeMullins_2009P_0017.wav: when i would have been a starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids ind the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using it the sorrus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P_0018.wav: i mean from this entury it would seem that i was borne into a world that perceived some one like me to have nothing positive what soever going for them when in fact to day
AimeeMullins_2009P_0019.wav: i'm celebrated fir ah the opportunities and adventures my life have procured so am i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P_0020.wav: went to look up the two thousand nine a on line adition expecting to find a rivision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P_0021.wav: unfortunately it's not much better i find thee the last two words under near antinums particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P_0022.wav: e o i
AimeeMullins_2009P_0023.wav: so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P_0024.wav: it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P_0025.wav: and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks in the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P_0026.wav: verbily was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P_0027.wav: baan
AimeeMullins_2009P_0028.wav: so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's impowered
AimeeMullins_2009P_0029.wav: 
AimeeMullins_2009P_0030.wav: by casually doing something as symble as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P_0031.wav: we might be pudding lidbs and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P_0032.wav: once at a person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the  a dipant institute in welmington delaware his name is doctor peetsa tillo
AimeeMullins_2009P_0033.wav: am no an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor pe and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P_0034.wav: always wore really colorful boties and am had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P_0035.wav: i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical fere precessions
AimeeMullins_2009P_0036.wav: i had to do what seeme like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands a different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P_0037.wav: to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P_0038.wav: you no i was already bargaining at a fidr old child with doctor pee to try to get out of doing hese exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P_0039.wav: and one day he came in to my session am exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P_0040.wav: thes sessions and he said to me wa ame you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P_0041.wav: i think yu'regon to break one of those bands when you do break it im moin to give you a hundred box now corse ti this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P_0042.wav: on doctor pa's part to get me to do the exercise as i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest fidyear old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P_0043.wav: but what he affectedly did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P_0044.wav: and i have to wonder to day to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P_0045.wav: as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and atholetic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P_0046.wav: this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P_0047.wav: but in the previous instances of those thesara centry yet our language isn't allowing us to envolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P_0048.wav: nor the possibility of an individual to see themselves is capable
AimeeMullins_2009P_0049.wav: 
AimeeMullins_2009P_0050.wav: our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which hae been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P_0051.wav: my legs ah no lazor surgery for vision imperament a tytanium knees and hip replacemens for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature is imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P_0052.wav: not to mention social net working platforms allows people to selth identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go aline with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P_0053.wav: bed
AimeeMullins_2009P_0054.wav: thou perhaps hycknowledgy is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that every one has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P_0055.wav: 
AimeeMullins_2009P_0056.wav: and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest ascet a human ability to adapt is an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P_0057.wav: have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P_0058.wav: and i'm an ammake an admission this prays never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P_0059.wav: implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P_0060.wav: is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P_0061.wav: as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side step or circum navogate the presume pitballs of a life with proschetics or what other people perceive is my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P_0062.wav: but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge wether physically emotionally or both and ominous suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P_0063.wav: adversity isn't an obstacle that we need toget around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P_0064.wav: and i ten to think of it like my shadow sometimes i feel lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P_0065.wav: at certainly i'm not trying to diminish bu impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P_0066.wav: adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not youre into met adversity but how aryou'r going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P_0067.wav: so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P_0068.wav: and we do a di service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P_0069.wav: there isan important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputi and the subjective socital opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P_0070.wav: and truthfully the only real and consistent dissibility i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P_0071.wav: in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognoses
AimeeMullins_2009P_0072.wav: or indeed aprognosis on the expected quality of their lifes we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P_0073.wav: disable somebody perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how to we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P_0074.wav: serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P_0075.wav: by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P_0076.wav: we are esfactivly grading some one's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P_0077.wav: and most importantly there is a partnership between those perceived efficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P_0078.wav: so it's not about devaluing or neggating me's more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P_0079.wav: wracked in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P_0080.wav: a
AimeeMullins_2009P_0081.wav: embracing it grappling with it the y's a wrestling term may be even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P_0082.wav: 
AimeeMullins_2009P_0083.wav: and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful were less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P_0084.wav: this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwine and it was a hundred fifty years ago when wriding about evolution the darwine illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P_0085.wav: to paroprase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P_0086.wav: conflict is the genisis of creation from darwine's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P_0087.wav: is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit threuwgh conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P_0088.wav: human skill and perhaps you know untill we're tested we dont know we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P_0089.wav: so we can give ourselves a gift we can reimagine adversity and something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P_0090.wav: maybe we can see it is change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves too yet
AimeeMullins_2009P_0091.wav: i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalty
AimeeMullins_2009P_0092.wav: and who's normal there 's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P_0093.wav: thre is no normal and would you wan to meet that poor base person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradime from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P_0094.wav: achieving normalty to one of possibility or potency do we even a ltlbit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P_0095.wav: theyare rare and valuable abilitiis with the community antherpologis tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P_0096.wav: there 's evidence that neander thaults sixty thousand years ago carried they are elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P_0097.wav: and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P_0098.wav: they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P_0099.wav: a few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up and that redzoan and north eastern pensylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P_0100.wav: and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i heard this gy his voice behind me say well if it isn't ame in mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P_0101.wav: i turn around and is his older man i have no idea who is and i said ah i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P_0102.wav: have we met i i don't remember meeting you you sai will ou woulnt remember meeting me we when we met i was delivering you from your mother's woom
AimeeMullins_2009P_0103.wav: so o  me oh that gy i's no mot amd of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P_0104.wav: it did click this man was doctor kean a man that i had only known about throuh my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P_0105.wav: thypical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks and so my mother's prenadale physician had gone on vacasion so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P_0106.wav: and because i was born with aut the sibla bones and had feet turned in and a few toes on this foot n a futosan tat he had to be the bearer the stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P_0107.wav: had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P_0108.wav: and youwould never have the kind of nobility that other kis have or any kind of life of independence and you'v been making a lier ata me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P_0109.wav: nano o te we  te ter
AimeeMullins_2009P_0110.wav: the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P_0111.wav: whether winning as second grade spelling b marching with the girl scowds you know the holloweam prade winning my collag scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P_0112.wav: and he was using it in integrating it into teaching a resident students med students from hanamen
AimeeMullins_2009P_0113.wav: medical school and hurtey medical school and he called this part of the corse the ex factor ther was t potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P_0114.wav: no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be in that as a determinate in the quality of some one's life
AimeeMullins_2009P_0115.wav: and doctor king went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P_0116.wav: and even if given a matama modicum of support is left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P_0117.wav: to doctor kene made that shift and thinking he understood that thre 's a difference between the medical condition and what some one might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P_0118.wav: andthere's been a shift in my thinking over time and that if you had ask me at fifteen years old if i would have trayed it prothetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P_0119.wav: i aspired to that kind of normal sy back then wodif yo ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P_0120.wav: and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P_0121.wav: and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P_0122.wav: to all you really need is one person to show you the apifiny of your own power and your off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P_0123.wav: to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for some one at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P_0124.wav: you're teaching them to open doors for themselves exactthe exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P_0125.wav: comes from the rouotword educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out patential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P_0126.wav: te
AimeeMullins_2009P_0127.wav: ther was a case study done in nineteen sixty's breaton when they were moving from compria grammar schools to comprehensive chools called the streaming triales we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P_0128.wav: here in the states its separating students from  b s d nd so on
AimeeMullins_2009P_0129.wav: and yo know the ay students get the toper coriculum the best teachers ec cetera while they took over a thee month period de level students gave the mase told them they were as told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P_0130.wav: they were performing at a level and of course the harp breaking flipside of the study is that they took the ay students
AimeeMullins_2009P_0131.wav: and told hem they were deas and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around an school bsides the drot people had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P_0132.wav: a
AimeeMullins_2009P_0133.wav: tisses the crucial part of of this caystudy was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P_0134.wav: the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the asuns these are the deastudents and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P_0135.wav: and treating them though i think
AimeeMullins_2009P_0136.wav: hath the only true disibility
AimeeMullins_2009P_0137.wav: is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P_0138.wav: it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity in our inate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P_0139.wav: 
AimeeMullins_2009P_0140.wav: if instead we can boster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P_0141.wav: to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P_0142.wav: when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P_0143.wav: i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet name hopic
AimeeMullins_2009P_0144.wav: and my friend jocdambas told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P_0145.wav: has known god not the god of names not the god of donts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P_0146.wav: and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P_0147.wav: wat t ave
BillGates_2010_0000.wav: e
BillGates_2010_0001.wav: how an i talk to day about energy and climate
BillGates_2010_0002.wav: and that might seem a bit surprising because mifull time work of the foundation is mostly about vaxins and sceeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest tubillion live better lives
BillGates_2010_0003.wav: but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet
BillGates_2010_0004.wav: the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow her'll be too much reaign not enough reign
BillGates_2010_0005.wav: a
BillGates_2010_0006.wav: things will change in ways that their feragul environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them
BillGates_2010_0007.wav: also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lor of the pricob to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down overtime
BillGates_2010_0008.wav: o really a advance civilization as based on aadvances in in energy the cold revolution fuweled
BillGates_2010_0009.wav: the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity an that's why we have erfrigerators air conditioning we can make o modern materials ind do so many things
BillGates_2010_0010.wav: and so were int a wonderful situation with a electricity in the rich world
BillGates_2010_0011.wav: 
BillGates_2010_0012.wav: but as we make a cheaper and let's say let's go for making it a twices cheap we need to meen a new constraint
BillGates_2010_0013.wav: and that constraint has to do with seo tu seo tu is warming the planet
BillGates_2010_0014.wav: and the ocquasionon seo to is actually a very straight forward one if you sum up the seo too that gets abmitted
BillGates_2010_0015.wav: that leads to a temperature increase and that temprature increase leads to some very negative effacts the effects on the weather
BillGates_2010_0016.wav: a perhaps worse the indirect effacts in that of the natrallegal systems cant ajust to these rapid changes and so you get echo system colopses
BillGates_2010_0017.wav: now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase in ofsio to
BillGates_2010_0018.wav: to what temperaturewill be in wear the positive febacks art there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
BillGates_2010_0019.wav: i asked the top sientist and as several times do we really have to get down to near zer can't we just and 'll cut itin a half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero
BillGates_2010_0020.wav: the temperature will continue to rise and so that's that's a big challenge it's very different than saying in a word twelve foot high truck tryin to get under a ten foot bridge and we can toa sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero
BillGates_2010_0021.wav: te
BillGates_2010_0022.wav: now we put out a lot of carpendioxide every year i'll over twenty six billion tons offer each american
BillGates_2010_0023.wav: it's about twenty tuns ah for people in poor countries it's less than one ton tsan average about five tongs for every one on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that we'll bring that down to zero
BillGates_2010_0024.wav: it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have evend flatened it a all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zerol this ocquasion as or factors
BillGates_2010_0025.wav: a little bit of multiplication so you got a thing on the left seo too that you want to get to zero and that's gin to be based on the number o people
BillGates_2010_0026.wav: the services each person josing on average the energy on average preach service and the seo too being put out
BillGates_2010_0027.wav: a purt unitov energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this tout into zeyro a probably one of these numbers is gen i have to get pretty near to zero
BillGates_2010_0028.wav: a that's back from a high school algegrub but let's let's take a look ah first we've got population
BillGates_2010_0029.wav: now the world to day has six point eight billion people that's head ed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on newbackscenes health care
BillGates_2010_0030.wav: reproductive held services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen per cent but there we see an increase of  about one point three
BillGates_2010_0031.wav: the second factor is the services we use this incompases everything the food we
BillGates_2010_0032.wav: clothing tv a heating these are very good things a getting rid of poverty means providing these servicees to almost every one on the planet and it's a great thing
BillGates_2010_0033.wav: a for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use lus but every year
BillGates_2010_0034.wav: this number on avrage is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person
BillGates_2010_0035.wav: here we have a very basic service do you have lightin in your house to be able to read your home warkand in fact these kids don'ts o the're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps
BillGates_2010_0036.wav: a
BillGates_2010_0037.wav: now efficiency  the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's nock going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting
BillGates_2010_0038.wav: a throug a different types of cars a different ways of building buildings there a a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially
BillGates_2010_0039.wav: some individual services even bring it down by ninety per cent there are other services like how we make ferlizer how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
BillGates_2010_0040.wav: and so over all here if ore obtimystic we may get a reduction of a a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex
BillGates_2010_0041.wav: but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billions to it best a maybe thirteen billion tuns and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's gon to be a key one
BillGates_2010_0042.wav: and this is the amount of seo tu put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can't you actually get that to zero ah if you burn coal
BillGates_2010_0043.wav: no af you burn aptorgaskan almost every way we maye electricity to day ah except o for the emerging runobles and newclear ou puts out seo too and so we're going to have to do it a global scale
BillGates_2010_0044.wav: is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i is the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible
BillGates_2010_0045.wav: ina day
BillGates_2010_0046.wav: the micer processor is a miracle the personal computers a miracle o the innernetnant servicees are a miracle so the people here of perticipated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a dead line
BillGates_2010_0047.wav: were we' have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and som com along some don't this is a case where we actuly have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a a pretty tight time line
BillGates_2010_0048.wav: now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of naptural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here
BillGates_2010_0049.wav: i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow o people enjoyed that
BillGates_2010_0050.wav: a
BillGates_2010_0051.wav: it really got them involved in the idea ah you no other people who live in the squitos so with energy i like to come upwit is this ah i decided that relleasing fireflies
BillGates_2010_0052.wav: would be my a contribution to the invironment here of this yeare so here we ave a somenowt reply flies i'm told they don't biht in fact they might even not even leave that jar ah
BillGates_2010_0053.wav: aaa
BillGates_2010_0054.wav: now ther's all sorts of gimik solutions like that one ah but they don't really ad up too much we need solutions either one or several that have
BillGates_2010_0055.wav: unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there 's many directions or people seeking i really only see five that
BillGates_2010_0056.wav: can achieve the big numbers i've left out tie ulthermal fusian viaphuls those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here
BillGates_2010_0057.wav: is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them ah because they they look daunting because they all
BillGates_2010_0058.wav: have significant challenges ill let's look first at the burning postl fuels either o burning coal or burning naptral gass what you nean to do there
BillGates_2010_0059.wav: yes
BillGates_2010_0060.wav: seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the seo too after you've burnt it going out the fle preshris it cradel liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
BillGates_2010_0061.wav: now we have some pilot things that do this that the sixteet eighty percent lavel but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a greenom weare these seo to quantitis should be put
BillGates_2010_0062.wav: i'll be hard but the topas one here is this long tremisue who's gin to be sure who's going to garran tea
BillGates_2010_0063.wav: a something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of newclyor other things this is a lot a volume
BillGates_2010_0064.wav: so that's a top one next a de nuglir it also has three big problems clost particlian highly regulated countries as high
BillGates_2010_0065.wav: the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that he din tot you have these human operators that the fuel
BillGates_2010_0066.wav: doesn't get used for weapons and then where it what do you do with the waste although it's not very large al tere a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tomp problems  that might be asolvable and so should be worked on
BillGates_2010_0067.wav: the last three of the five i've grouped together ah these are what people often referr to is the renewable sources and they actually
BillGates_2010_0068.wav: although it's great they don't requile fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the dencity
BillGates_2010_0069.wav: h energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming
BillGates_2010_0070.wav: seare talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than than you think of its a normal energy plant also these are intermitant sources athe sun doesn't shine
BillGates_2010_0071.wav: all day itdoesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so f you depend on these sources
BillGates_2010_0072.wav: you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here
BillGates_2010_0073.wav: ah we have transmission challenges for example sav this energy sourceis outside your country ah yu not only need the technology but you have to a deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storiage problem
BillGates_2010_0074.wav: and to dimantinalize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computors for foms for flash lights for everything and compared that
BillGates_2010_0075.wav: to the amount of electicl energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes
BillGates_2010_0076.wav: of all the energy and so in fact we need a big break through here something that's going to be
BillGates_2010_0077.wav: a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the intermentan source to be above say twenty to thirty per cent
BillGates_2010_0078.wav: of what you're using if you're counting on it for a hundred per cent you need a anincredible miracle battery
BillGates_2010_0079.wav: now how are ging to go forwaird on this what's what's the right approach is it a ban hant an project what's the the thing that can get us there what we needs wants
BillGates_2010_0080.wav: of companies a working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need  least a hundred people and lot of im youll look at and say they're crazy that's good
BillGates_2010_0081.wav: and i think here in the ted group we have many people ah who are already pursuing this ah
BillGates_2010_0082.wav: pill gros hav several companies in clem one called eas soler that has some great soler thormal technology a van od cosas in vesting an dozens of conpanies ah that a're doing great things and have a interesting possibilities and i'm i'm trying to help back that a nathe meribale than i actually are backing a company
BillGates_2010_0083.wav: that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the newclear approach of there are some inevations in newcleiar mogler liquid
BillGates_2010_0084.wav: ah an inevation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around ah is not all that surprising the ide of a terro power
BillGates_2010_0085.wav: is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one per cent of jusyeu to thirty five we decided will let's burn the ninety nine per cent
BillGates_2010_0086.wav: the yeu tu thirty eighth it is kind of a crazy idean in fact people had talked about it for a long time
BillGates_2010_0087.wav: but they could never stimulate properly whether it would work or not and so it's through the advent of modern super computers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right
BillGates_2010_0088.wav: material's approach ah this a looks like it would work and because you'r burning that ninetie nine per cent a you have
BillGates_2010_0089.wav: a greatly improved cost a profile you actually burn up the waste and you can act useas fuel all the left over waste from todays reactors andso instead of warring about them you just take that it's a great thing
BillGates_2010_0090.wav: it breeds this uranium as it goes along so t kiny like tha candle and sees its alogthera often referred to us a travelling wayvreactor and terms a ful
BillGates_2010_0091.wav: now this really solves the probem i've got a picture here of a place in contaki this is the left over the ninety nine per cent where they'v taken out the part they bure now so's called to pleaded juranium that would power the you ask
BillGates_2010_0092.wav: for hundreds of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process youd have enough fuwl for the entire lifetime on the rest of the planet so
BillGates_2010_0093.wav: you know it's got lots lots of challenge as i had but it is an example of the many hundreds ond hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
BillGates_2010_0094.wav: sol let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card i'll look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and and then i'll look at the intermediate for twenty fifty you've heard many people talk about
BillGates_2010_0095.wav: this eighty percant reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by
BillGates_2010_0096.wav: things going on in poor countries still some agriculture ol hoply we will have cleaned up a forest re simant a so to get to that eighty per cent the developed countries
BillGates_2010_0097.wav: including countries like china we'll have had a swuitch their electri electriity generation all to gether ah so the other great is are we deploying
BillGates_2010_0098.wav: this zeromission tecnology have we deployed it in all the develope countries and were in the processos of getting it out elsewhere that' superimportant
BillGates_2010_0099.wav: at's a key element of making that report card so backing up from there let you the twenty twenty report card look like
BillGates_2010_0100.wav: well itagain it should have the two elements ad we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the lest we amit the last that sum will be of siotu and therefore the last the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there
BillGates_2010_0101.wav: doing things that don't get us all the way to the big redoctions is only equallyer may be even slightly less important than the other which is the pieace of inevation
BillGates_2010_0102.wav: on these break throughse these break throughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulartory things that have been changed
BillGates_2010_0103.wav: ther's a lot of great books that meem written about this the algor book our choice and the david makai book su stain oble energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think angreat of a frame work that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this
BillGates_2010_0104.wav: other's a lota the house to come together so this is a wish it's a very concreet wish that
BillGates_2010_0105.wav: we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifth years i can pick whose president i can pick of acceme
BillGates_2010_0106.wav: which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no sio two gets invented
BillGates_2010_0107.wav: this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish the division between the people who think short termn long ter will be terrible
BillGates_2010_0108.wav: between youis and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lifes of those two billions will be far worse so what do we have to do what am my appealing a tyu de a step forward and
BillGates_2010_0109.wav: and drive we needed  to go for war research funding and when countries get together at places like copan hagin teyshen
BillGates_2010_0110.wav: justiscost the sio too they should discuss this inovation of genda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously lo level suspending
BillGates_2010_0111.wav: on these inivative approaches we neent do need the market in centits seo tutaxs capantrades something that gets that price signal out there
BillGates_2010_0112.wav: we need to get the message out we need have this dialogu be a more rashon al more understandable dialogue a including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you
BillGates_2010_0113.wav: 
BillGates_2010_0114.wav: tak yo tank yo
BillGates_2010_0115.wav: otok
BillGates_2010_0116.wav: thank you asit to understamd more about about ta terapala right a
BillGates_2010_0117.wav: weonpfessor wwa can give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this ays
BillGates_2010_0118.wav: but to to actually do this soft were by the supercompudor hier all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out
BillGates_2010_0119.wav: ah in a russianryactor to make sure that ar materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions the tothing is building the pilot reactor
BillGates_2010_0120.wav: a finding the saverobillion a finding the the regulator the location that will actally build the first one of these one should get the first one built
BillGates_2010_0121.wav: if it works as advertise then it's ust clear as day because the economics the energudensity are so different than newcler as we know it
BillGates_2010_0122.wav: and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almos like like a verticle knd of colum of nuclier fl of this sortof spanouraniam and then an then and then the presces starts at the top and  kin of works down
BillGates_2010_0123.wav: that's right to day you're always refuling the reactoracy of lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing wereyo're opening it up and moving things in and out that's
BillGates_2010_0124.wav: that's not good so if you han't bery very cheep fuel then you can put sixty years end just think of it is a log
BillGates_2010_0125.wav: put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixth years ah and and then it's done
BillGates_2010_0126.wav: it's its anu cleer paprontha is its own wist disposal solution
BillGates_2010_0127.wav: yelo wud hammens with the waiste you can you can let it sit there ah there's a lot less waiste under this approach ah then you can actully take that and put it into another one and burn that
BillGates_2010_0128.wav: and and we start out acty by teaking the waste that exists today that sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors that's our ful
BillGates_2010_0129.wav: to begin with so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed ind ars and you're reducing the volume of the wayst quite dramatically as you're going through this process
BillGates_2010_0130.wav: antyou'r talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where wheare is theire most interest in actually doing something with this
BillGates_2010_0131.wav: well we haven't ah picked a particular place but ah and there's all these a interesting disclosure rules a bout anning that's called nuklir
BillGates_2010_0132.wav: ah
BillGates_2010_0133.wav: so i wewe've got a lot of interest ah the people from the company hav ben in rusia india china i've been back sein the secretary of energyou hear or talking about how this
BillGates_2010_0134.wav: ah fits in to the the energeogenda sa noptomystic ah into the prancin japanese of donsemorgthis is a avariant on something that has been done it's an important
BillGates_2010_0135.wav: advance but it's like a fast ractor in a lot of compcountries to built them so anybody use donafastractor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built
BillGates_2010_0136.wav: so in in your mind am time scale and likelihood arv actually taking cetin lighte their slive
BillGates_2010_0137.wav: what we need for one of these
BillGates_2010_0138.wav: hy scale or electric electrcal generation things that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that sort of the dead line
BillGates_2010_0139.wav: that the environ models environmental modls of have have shown us that we have to meat and in otera power if things go wal
BillGates_2010_0140.wav: o which is wishing for lot could easily meet that and there are a fortunately now dozens of companies we needbe hundreds
BillGates_2010_0141.wav: who likewise if their cience goes well if the funnin for their pliant pilot plants goes well that they they can compeep for this and it's bast if multible succeed because then ou to use a mix amixt these things we certainly need wont to succeed
BillGates_2010_0142.wav: maintoms of big scale or possible game changes tthisis the biggest that you are aware of out that
BillGates_2010_0143.wav: an energy break through is the the most important thing it would have been even without the envire mentalcome sfrin but the inviroemelancones frate just makes thit so much
BillGates_2010_0144.wav: ah
BillGates_2010_0145.wav: so much greater in the new cleaer space there are other enevators ah nof we don't know there wer as well as we know this one but
BillGates_2010_0146.wav: the modgeler people ow that's a different approach there's a liquid typry actor which seems little hard bumaybe they say about us
BillGates_2010_0147.wav: bad
BillGates_2010_0148.wav: and so there there are different ones but the the beauty of this is a molcue of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molicule of say coal
BillGates_2010_0149.wav: 
BillGates_2010_0150.wav: and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprinting cost the patential ind terms of effect on land and varies things is in almost iny class of its own
BillGates_2010_0151.wav: ter bi
BillGates_2010_0152.wav: if this doesn't wok
BillGates_2010_0153.wav: am
BillGates_2010_0154.wav: thenwhat do we have to stop taking imugincy measures to try and keep the temperature of the eath stable
BillGates_2010_0155.wav: yet if you' get into that situation it's like
BillGates_2010_0156.wav: if youre
BillGates_2010_0157.wav: you've been over eating and you'reabout t have a hartattack and on then then then where do you go you may need heard surger something there is a line of research on what's called ge angineerian
BillGates_2010_0158.wav: which are various technicues that would delay the heeding to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together
BillGates_2010_0159.wav: now you hope that's just an entrance palsy you hope you don't need to do that some people say you shoun even work on the intrance palscy because it might make you
BillGates_2010_0160.wav: lazy that you'll keep eating because you know heart sirgeryi'll be there to save you i'm not sure that's wis given the importance of the problem but
BillGates_2010_0161.wav: ah theres now that the geoingineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this inevation goes a lots slower than we expect
BillGates_2010_0162.wav: 
BillGates_2010_0163.wav: climate skeptics if you had dem a sentence or two to say to them how how might you persuade them that they are wong
BillGates_2010_0164.wav: aee
BillGates_2010_0165.wav: well unfortunaely the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few
BillGates_2010_0166.wav: in are they saying that there's nagative feed back effects have to do with clouds that off sat things they're very very few things that they can even say in ol there's a chance and a million of those things the main prim you have here
BillGates_2010_0167.wav: it's kind like aids  you make a mistake now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now
BillGates_2010_0168.wav: that how to do it ta gain later in is somewhat uncertain a painting in fact the ipe se sea report you no that
BillGates_2010_0169.wav: that's not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the ritrol to look at ipisese and say ocay you kno that that isn't that big of veal the fact is its that uncertain part
BillGates_2010_0170.wav: that should move us towards us but my dream here is that if you can make it acanomic anne meet the sio to constraint then the sceptic saoca
BillGates_2010_0171.wav: i don't care that it doesn't put outsio to i kind i wish it did put out seo tou but i guess i'll except it causet's cheeper
BillGates_2010_0172.wav: tat autrigt what's come before
BillGates_2010_0173.wav: 
BillGates_2010_0174.wav: o
BillGates_2010_0175.wav: 
BillGates_2010_0176.wav: and so that woul be yor response to the tha the biyn lamborg argument that basitly if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve the seer too problem is con to take away all your other golls of trying to rid the world of poverty an milaryan ser for this its it is it is tha stupid waste of the irth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do
BillGates_2010_0177.wav: yet ol the actual spending on the arndpiece a you on say th you i should spend ten billiiar more than it is right now it's not that dramatic it shouldn't take away from other things the thing you get into big money on
BillGates_2010_0178.wav: and this reasonable people can discrease when you have somesnonic annomich and you're trying to fund that that to me mostly is a waste unless you're very close in you're just funnyin the learning curbin it's goin to get very cheep i believe we should try in a more
BillGates_2010_0179.wav: a things that have a patential to be far less expensive if the traid off ye get into is let's make energys super and super
BillGates_2010_0180.wav: a expensive then the rich con afford that mean all of us here could pay five times as much for or energy and not change our life style
BillGates_2010_0181.wav: the disaster is for that tubillion and even lanborg has changed ah his stick now is whysan thearnd
BillGates_2010_0182.wav: ah getting more disgust he hes still because it his earlier stoffs sort of associate with the sceptic camp but he's realized that's that's a pretty lonely camp and and so
BillGates_2010_0183.wav: ah he's making the arin dee point and and so there is a a a threat of something that a i think i's appropriate the arin dee piece it's crazy how little it's fundo
BillGates_2010_0184.wav: fa
BillGates_2010_0185.wav: will bill i suspect i a speak a barf of most people here ah to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much

DanBarber_2010_0000.wav: oo
DanBarber_2010_0001.wav: so i've known a lot of fish in my life
DanBarber_2010_0002.wav: i've loved only too
DanBarber_2010_0003.wav: at first one was that
DanBarber_2010_0004.wav: it was more like a passionate affair
DanBarber_2010_0005.wav: it was a beautiful fish
DanBarber_2010_0006.wav: flavorful taxcared
DanBarber_2010_0007.wav: medy a bast sallar on the menu what a fish
DanBarber_2010_0008.wav: ea  oee
DanBarber_2010_0009.wav: even better it was farm raised to the supposeed highest standards of sustainability
DanBarber_2010_0010.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0011.wav: seak if ye'll goot about selling it
DanBarber_2010_0012.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0013.wav: i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months
DanBarber_2010_0014.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0015.wav: one day the head of the company called and asked if i'd speak out an event
DanBarber_2010_0016.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0017.wav: bout the farms sistain ability absolutely i said
DanBarber_2010_0018.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0019.wav: here's a company trying to solve
DanBarber_2010_0020.wav: what's become this unimaginable problem for a sheps
DanBarber_2010_0021.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0022.wav: how do we keep fish on our menus
DanBarber_2010_0023.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0024.wav: for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas
DanBarber_2010_0025.wav: like we clear cut forres
DanBarber_2010_0026.wav: os
DanBarber_2010_0027.wav: it's hard to overstraigt the destruction
DanBarber_2010_0028.wav: nine ty per cent a large fish the ones we love the tun as the hallobets the sammons swordfish the clept tallwas nothing left
DanBarber_2010_0029.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0030.wav: so for better for worse acquiculture fish farming seery part of our future
DanBarber_2010_0031.wav: a lot of arguments against it
DanBarber_2010_0032.wav: fish farms balup
DanBarber_2010_0033.wav: most of them do anyway and tey're inefficient take tunam the major draw back
DanBarber_2010_0034.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0035.wav: is got a feed conversion rasio a fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tona
DanBarber_2010_0036.wav: not very sustainable done tayes very good either
DanBarber_2010_0037.wav: de
DanBarber_2010_0038.wav: so herefinally
DanBarber_2010_0039.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0040.wav: was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support him
DanBarber_2010_0041.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0042.wav: the day before the evant i called they head a piare for the company
DanBarber_2010_0043.wav: what's call him don
DanBarber_2010_0044.wav: down i sa jus to get the facts traiht you gies are famous for from farming so far out to sea you you don't palute that's right he said we're so far out
DanBarber_2010_0045.wav: the waste from our fish gets distributed
DanBarber_2010_0046.wav: not concentrated and then he added
DanBarber_2010_0047.wav: ore basically a world unto ourselves
DanBarber_2010_0048.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0049.wav: a fee conversin racio two point five to on he said best in the business

DanBarber_2010_0122.wav: he's a biologist
DanBarber_2010_0123.wav: at vectalapamma it's a fish farm in the south western corner of spane
DanBarber_2010_0124.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0125.wav: it's at the tip of the guadalicavir river
DanBarber_2010_0126.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0127.wav: until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians
DanBarber_2010_0128.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0129.wav: they raised beef cattle ammal was assentially wet lancs
DanBarber_2010_0130.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0131.wav: they did it by draining land they built this intricate series of canals
DanBarber_2010_0132.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0133.wav: and they pushed water off the land and out into the river
DanBarber_2010_0134.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0135.wav: whil hey couldn't make it work not economically
DanBarber_2010_0136.wav: and echologically it was a disaster
DanBarber_2010_0137.wav: a
DanBarber_2010_0138.wav: killed like ninety percent of the birds which for this place i the lotto birds
DanBarber_2010_0139.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0140.wav: and so in nineteen eighty two
DanBarber_2010_0141.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0142.wav: a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchase the land what did they do
DanBarber_2010_0143.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0144.wav: they were verse the flow of water they literally flipped the switch
DanBarber_2010_0145.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0146.wav: set a pushing water out
DanBarber_2010_0147.wav: they used the channels to pull water back in they flouttered the canals
DanBarber_2010_0148.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0149.wav: they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fon
DanBarber_2010_0150.wav: bas mollyd shrimp eel
DanBarber_2010_0151.wav: any in the process migal and this company
DanBarber_2010_0152.wav: completely reversed the echological destruction
DanBarber_2010_0153.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0154.wav: the farm's incredible i'mn you've never seen anything like this
DanBarber_2010_0155.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0156.wav: he stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are fluttered canals and this thick rich marsh lam
DanBarber_2010_0157.wav:

DanBarber_2010_0165.wav: there we are flogging through the wet land
DanBarber_2010_0166.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0167.wav: and om panting and sweating at mudd up to my knees and me gale is calmly conducting a biology lecture
DanBarber_2010_0168.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0169.wav: here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kipe
DanBarber_2010_0170.wav: now i's mentioning
DanBarber_2010_0171.wav: the mineral needs the fighto plang them
DanBarber_2010_0172.wav: and here here he sees a grouping patder the reminds him of the tanzinian geraf
DanBarber_2010_0173.wav: ti
DanBarber_2010_0174.wav: it turns out mi gale spent the better part of his career in the macoommi national park in africa
DanBarber_2010_0175.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0176.wav: i asked him how he became such an expert on fish said fish
DanBarber_2010_0177.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0178.wav: might a now anything about fish
DanBarber_2010_0179.wav: i'm an expert in relationships
DanBarber_2010_0180.wav: and then he's off
DanBarber_2010_0181.wav: launching into more talk about rayre birds and alges and strange a quatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinate you know the biatic community unplugged cannethan you know 'sgrape
DanBarber_2010_0182.wav: but i was i lup and my head
DanBarber_2010_0183.wav: was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before so i interrupt end mi sent me gown what makes your fish taste so good
DanBarber_2010_0184.wav: we pointad the algey
DanBarber_2010_0185.wav: i knowdo the algy the fight o plang then the relationship sits es amazing
DanBarber_2010_0186.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0187.wav: right bu what ae your fish eatint and what's the feed comversion racia
DanBarber_2010_0188.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0189.wav: weu goes on to tell me
DanBarber_2010_0190.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0191.wav: it's such a rich system
DanBarber_2010_0192.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0193.wav: that the fish are eating what they beating in thewild
DanBarber_2010_0194.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0195.wav: the plant byal mask to fight up mine the zoop lines and it's what feeds the fish the system is so healpy it's totally self for newing
DanBarber_2010_0196.wav: there is no feed
DanBarber_2010_0197.wav: ever heard of a farm the dozen feet its animals
DanBarber_2010_0198.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0199.wav: later that day i was driving round this property with me galin i asked him aself for a place it seemed so natural
DanBarber_2010_0200.wav: abe e
DanBarber_2010_0201.wav: unlike any fish for aleganty farm i'd ever been at
DanBarber_2010_0202.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0203.wav: withow do you measure success
DanBarber_2010_0204.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0205.wav: at that moment it's as if a film director called for a sect change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingus
DanBarber_2010_0206.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0207.wav: a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see
DanBarber_2010_0208.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0209.wav: that success he said
DanBarber_2010_0210.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0211.wav: look at their balleys pink they're feasting
DanBarber_2010_0212.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0213.wav: cheasting as tally confes i said  me ge aent they fasting on your fish
DanBarber_2010_0214.wav: ao
DanBarber_2010_0215.wav: yes he said
DanBarber_2010_0216.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0217.wav: we lose twenty percan of our fish and fish eggs to birds
DanBarber_2010_0218.wav: a
DanBarber_2010_0219.wav: i will last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it
DanBarber_2010_0220.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0221.wav: more than two hundred fifty different species it's become to day the largest
DanBarber_2010_0222.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0223.wav: and one of the most important
DanBarber_2010_0224.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0225.wav: private bird sanctuaries in all of europe
DanBarber_2010_0226.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0227.wav: i sein to me gale isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fishfarm
DanBarber_2010_0228.wav: at ii a aa
DanBarber_2010_0229.wav: he shook his head now he said
DanBarber_2010_0230.wav: we farmd extensively
DanBarber_2010_0231.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0232.wav: not intensively
DanBarber_2010_0233.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0234.wav: this is an ecological net work
DanBarber_2010_0235.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0236.wav: the flumingoes eat the shrimp the shrimpeap the fihto plank an so the pinker the belly the better the system
DanBarber_2010_0237.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0238.wav: look ats  let's review a farm tha dozen feet its animals
DanBarber_2010_0239.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0240.wav: an a farm that measures its success
DanBarber_2010_0241.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0242.wav: on the health of its preditors
DanBarber_2010_0243.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0244.wav: a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary
DanBarber_2010_0245.wav: e
DanBarber_2010_0246.wav: oh and by the way those flemingas they shouldn't even be there in the first place
DanBarber_2010_0247.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0248.wav: they brode in a town a hundred an fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nest
DanBarber_2010_0249.wav: at
DanBarber_2010_0250.wav: every morning they fly one hundreda fifty miles into the farm
DanBarber_2010_0251.wav: aa
DanBarber_2010_0252.wav: and every evening they fly one hunr or fifty miles back
DanBarber_2010_0253.wav: a tta aaaaaaa ta eetee
DanBarber_2010_0254.wav: they do that because they're able to follow the broken whihte line of highway e ninety two
DanBarber_2010_0255.wav: oaa
DanBarber_2010_0256.wav: no getting
DanBarber_2010_0257.wav: tae a e t   teen
DanBarber_2010_0258.wav: now i was imagining a march of the penguins theng you know so i looked at me galle i said
DanBarber_2010_0259.wav: me gal do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm
DanBarber_2010_0260.wav: and then do they fly one hundr ad fifty miles back at night
DanBarber_2010_0261.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0262.wav: do they do that for the children
DanBarber_2010_0263.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0264.wav: he looked at me like i just quartered a witme hustan saw
DanBarber_2010_0265.wav: de io
DanBarber_2010_0266.wav: he said no they' do i cas the food's better
DanBarber_2010_0267.wav: iia a  i ats on ta  ata o
DanBarber_2010_0268.wav: o i didn't mantion the skin of my beloved fish
DanBarber_2010_0269.wav: i iaaa
DanBarber_2010_0270.wav: which was delicious and i don't like fish skin i don't like it seered i'm a like it chrispy
DanBarber_2010_0271.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0272.wav: is that accorid tarlike flavor
DanBarber_2010_0273.wav: i must never cook with it
DanBarber_2010_0274.wav: yet when i tasted it at that restarant in southern span it tasted not at all like firskin
DanBarber_2010_0275.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0276.wav: a tasted sweet and clean
DanBarber_2010_0277.wav: a
DanBarber_2010_0278.wav: like you were taking a bite of the ocean
DanBarber_2010_0279.wav: a
DanBarber_2010_0280.wav: i mentioned that to megalan he nodded he said the skin as like a spunge s a last e fence before anything enters the body it ivolved
DanBarber_2010_0281.wav: to soak up impurities and then he added
DanBarber_2010_0282.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0283.wav: but our water has no impurities
DanBarber_2010_0284.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0285.wav: oka a farm the dozen feet its fish
DanBarber_2010_0286.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0287.wav: a farm the measures is success
DanBarber_2010_0288.wav: by the success of its preditors
DanBarber_2010_0289.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0290.wav: and then i realize when he says
DanBarber_2010_0291.wav: a farm that has no impurities he made a big under statement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the guatelic of your river
DanBarber_2010_0292.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0293.wav: s a river that carries with it all the things the rivers tend to carry these days
DanBarber_2010_0294.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0295.wav: chemical contammonents pestaside run off
DanBarber_2010_0296.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0297.wav: and when it works its way through the system
DanBarber_2010_0298.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0299.wav: and leaves the water it's cleaner than wen it enter
DanBarber_2010_0300.wav: a
DanBarber_2010_0301.wav: the system is so healthy it purifies the water
DanBarber_2010_0302.wav: u
DanBarber_2010_0303.wav: so not just a farm tha dozen feet its animals not just a farm tha measures the health
DanBarber_2010_0304.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0305.wav: they had success by the health of its preditors
DanBarber_2010_0306.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0307.wav: but a farm that's literally all water purification plant
DanBarber_2010_0308.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0309.wav: and not just for those fish
DanBarber_2010_0310.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0311.wav: but for you and me as wealth because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic
DanBarber_2010_0312.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0313.wav: a drop in the ocean i know but i'll take it and so should you
DanBarber_2010_0314.wav: ba te
DanBarber_2010_0315.wav: because this love story
DanBarber_2010_0316.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0317.wav: however romantic is also instructive
DanBarber_2010_0318.wav: you might say it's aracipy for the future of good food
DanBarber_2010_0319.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0320.wav: whether were talking about bass or beef cattle
DanBarber_2010_0321.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0322.wav: what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good
DanBarber_2010_0323.wav: tat o oto to o  wain
DanBarber_2010_0324.wav: but for a lot of people
DanBarber_2010_0325.wav: that's a big too radical
DanBarber_2010_0326.wav: we're not realists aspudes
DanBarber_2010_0327.wav: were lovers
DanBarber_2010_0328.wav: we love farmer's markets we love small family farms
DanBarber_2010_0329.wav: we talk about local food wead organic
DanBarber_2010_0330.wav: so a  tat bi
DanBarber_2010_0331.wav: and when you suggest these are the things that will in shore
DanBarber_2010_0332.wav: the future of good food some one some where stands up and says hega
DanBarber_2010_0333.wav: i
DanBarber_2010_0334.wav: alo thank flemmngas but how youdon't fee the world
DanBarber_2010_0335.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0336.wav: hawaguntopeed the worlds can i be honest i don't love that question
DanBarber_2010_0337.wav: a
DanBarber_2010_0338.wav: no not because we already produce anoff calleries to more than feed the world
DanBarber_2010_0339.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0340.wav: one billion peepal
DanBarber_2010_0341.wav: ec
DanBarber_2010_0342.wav: we'll go hungry to day one illion that's more than ever before
DanBarber_2010_0343.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0344.wav: because of gross in equalities and distribution not tunishe
DanBarber_2010_0345.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0346.wav: hat i don't love this question because it's the term an the logic of our food system for last fifty years
DanBarber_2010_0347.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0348.wav: feed grained arbavorse
DanBarber_2010_0349.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0350.wav: pest te sides to monocultures chemicals to soil chickened a fish
DanBarber_2010_0351.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0352.wav: and all long agrabusiness has simply asked
DanBarber_2010_0353.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0354.wav: if for feeling more people more cheeply how terrible could that be
DanBarber_2010_0355.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0356.wav: that's been the motive ation speend the justification it's been the business plant
DanBarber_2010_0357.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0358.wav: of american agriculture we shul call itwhat it is
DanBarber_2010_0359.wav: a
DanBarber_2010_0360.wav: a business and liquidation
DanBarber_2010_0361.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0362.wav: a business that's quickly a roating ecological capital that makes that very production possible
DanBarber_2010_0363.wav: a souht of business and his agriculture
DanBarber_2010_0364.wav: our bread basket is threatened to day not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
DanBarber_2010_0365.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0366.wav: not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertil land
DanBarber_2010_0367.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0368.wav: not by pumps but by fresh water
DanBarber_2010_0369.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0370.wav: not by chain saws but by forres and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the seak wont of mo the world
DanBarber_2010_0371.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0372.wav: let's start by asking how we one to feet ourselves
DanBarber_2010_0373.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0374.wav: or better how can we create conditions that enable every community
DanBarber_2010_0375.wav: defeed its elf
DanBarber_2010_0376.wav: u
DanBarber_2010_0377.wav: to do that don't look
DanBarber_2010_0378.wav: at the agrabusus model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's highon capital camistry and machines
DanBarber_2010_0379.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0380.wav: and it's never produced anything really good to
DanBarber_2010_0381.wav: e    a
DanBarber_2010_0382.wav: instead let's look to the achological mottle
DanBarber_2010_0383.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0384.wav: that's the one that relies on two billion years
DanBarber_2010_0385.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0386.wav: of on the job experience
DanBarber_2010_0387.wav: look to me gale farmers like me gile
DanBarber_2010_0388.wav: farms that aren't worlds unto themselves
DanBarber_2010_0389.wav: farms that
DanBarber_2010_0390.wav: restore instead of depleet farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively
DanBarber_2010_0391.wav: e
DanBarber_2010_0392.wav: farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships
DanBarber_2010_0393.wav: cas there the ones
DanBarber_2010_0394.wav: they're experts in flavour too
DanBarber_2010_0395.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0396.wav: and if i'm goin to be really honest
DanBarber_2010_0397.wav: 
DanBarber_2010_0398.wav: there are better chaft than i'll ever bi
DanBarber_2010_0399.wav: you don't lokaye it that
DanBarber_2010_0400.wav: because if that's the future of good food it's gon to be delicious thank you
DanBarber_2010_0401.wav: eeis  ba dutees bua  is tee oduteis ua edo tedodo do o do do to
DanielKahneman_2010_0000.wav: oo
DanielKahneman_2010_0001.wav: everybody talks about happiness these days
DanielKahneman_2010_0002.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0003.wav: i had somebody counce the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years
DanielKahneman_2010_0004.wav: and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
DanielKahneman_2010_0005.wav: there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researches there is a lot of happiness colching everybody would like to make people happier
DanielKahneman_2010_0006.wav: r obad
DanielKahneman_2010_0007.wav: but in spite of all this flood of work there are several coof traps that would have make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness
DanielKahneman_2010_0008.wav: and my talk to day will be mostly about these conglive traps thus applies to lay people thinking bof their own happiness and it ap plice to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out where just as mes stopp as anybody elses
DanielKahneman_2010_0009.wav: a
DanielKahneman_2010_0010.wav: the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity turns out that the word happiness is just not a youthful word any more because we applied to too many different things
DanielKahneman_2010_0011.wav: i think there is one particular meaning forto which we might restrict it but by and large this as something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is
DanielKahneman_2010_0012.wav: the second trap is a confusion between experience ind memory maseclets between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and tare both lump in the notion of happiness
DanielKahneman_2010_0013.wav: and the third is it's the folcasing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that effects well being without distorting its importance anin this is a real cogetive trap there is just no way of getting it right
DanielKahneman_2010_0014.wav: a
DanielKahneman_2010_0015.wav: now i'd like to start with an example of somebody
DanielKahneman_2010_0016.wav: whed a question and answer assertion after one of my lectures
DanielKahneman_2010_0017.wav: reported a story and that wer the story he said he had been listening to a syinphany
DanielKahneman_2010_0018.wav: and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added greading quite emotionally
DanielKahneman_2010_0019.wav: it ruined the whole experience
DanielKahneman_2010_0020.wav: but the tabdents
DanielKahneman_2010_0021.wav: when it had ruined where the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep
DanielKahneman_2010_0022.wav: when this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selvs ah there is an experiencing self
DanielKahneman_2010_0023.wav: who lives in the present
DanielKahneman_2010_0024.wav: and knows the present 's capable of reliving the past abasicly it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor us does it hurt now when i thought true here
DanielKahneman_2010_0025.wav: and then there is a remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010_0026.wav: and the remembering self is the one that keeps score
DanielKahneman_2010_0027.wav: and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor
DanielKahneman_2010_0028.wav: approachers in asking the question
DanielKahneman_2010_0029.wav: op
DanielKahneman_2010_0030.wav: how have you been feeling lately o how as your trip to obanio something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self
DanielKahneman_2010_0031.wav: and te and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of amess about the notion of happiness
DanielKahneman_2010_0032.wav: a
DanielKahneman_2010_0033.wav: now the remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010_0034.wav: is a story teller and that really starvs with a basick
DanielKahneman_2010_0035.wav: response of our memories starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story
DanielKahneman_2010_0036.wav: and let me begin with one example
DanielKahneman_2010_0037.wav: thus es an old study those are actual patients under going a painful procedur a on going to detail it's no longer painfor these days but it was painful whin thesix when this study was run in t nineteen nineties
DanielKahneman_2010_0038.wav: there ars the report of their pagn every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their their recordings and who are asked
DanielKahneman_2010_0039.wav: who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question a inclearly patient be suffered more ifs colonoscopy was longer and everyem
DanielKahneman_2010_0040.wav: minute of pain that patient a had patient bhad and more but now there is another question
DanielKahneman_2010_0041.wav: how much did these patients think they suffered
DanielKahneman_2010_0042.wav: a
DanielKahneman_2010_0043.wav: and here is a surprise
DanielKahneman_2010_0044.wav: and the surprisis that patient a had a much worse memory of the olonoscopy than patient by the stories of the colonosopies were different
DanielKahneman_2010_0045.wav: and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends
DanielKahneman_2010_0046.wav: and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is thisthinc but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse if the one where pain was let its speak at the very end
DanielKahneman_2010_0047.wav: it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscope and much later too how bad was the whole thing intotal and it was much worse for a than forbee in memory
DanielKahneman_2010_0048.wav: now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the rememberingslf from the point of you of the experiencing self clearly be had a worse time
DanielKahneman_2010_0049.wav: now what you could do with patient a and we actually ranclynical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoskopy of patient a by just keeping the toubin without driggling it too much that will
DanielKahneman_2010_0050.wav: that will cause the patient to suffer bu dressed a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencingself of patient a worse off
DanielKahneman_2010_0051.wav: and you've made the remembering self of patient a a lot better off because now you have endowed patient a
DanielKahneman_2010_0052.wav: with a better story about his experience
DanielKahneman_2010_0053.wav: fenia
DanielKahneman_2010_0054.wav: what thet finds te story
DanielKahneman_2010_0055.wav: and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up when ther finds a story aur changers significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominateit
DanielKahneman_2010_0056.wav: a
DanielKahneman_2010_0057.wav: now the experiencingself lives its life
DanielKahneman_2010_0058.wav: continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straight forward
DanielKahneman_2010_0059.wav: they are lost for ever me most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know tho psychological presents is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know and in ar life they areabout six hundred millions of them in a months ther re about six hundred thousand
DanielKahneman_2010_0060.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0061.wav: most of them don't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010_0062.wav: and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count
DanielKahneman_2010_0063.wav: that what happens during these moments of experience is our life
DanielKahneman_2010_0064.wav: it's the finight resorse that we are spending while we are on this earth
DanielKahneman_2010_0065.wav: and how to spend it would seem to be relavant but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us so we have the
DanielKahneman_2010_0066.wav: rememberingself and the experiencing self and they are really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time
DanielKahneman_2010_0067.wav: ta
DanielKahneman_2010_0068.wav: from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vication and the second week is dust as good as the first then
DanielKahneman_2010_0069.wav: the two week vication is twice as good as the one week vocation  that's not the wayit works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vocation is barely better
DanielKahneman_2010_0070.wav: than the one week vocation because they'r ane known new memories added you have not trained the story
DanielKahneman_2010_0071.wav: and in this way time is actually the critical variable the distinguishes a rememberingsof from our experiencing so time has very little impart on the story
DanielKahneman_2010_0072.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0073.wav: now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions
DanielKahneman_2010_0074.wav: because if you have a patient wo has had say to colonoscopies with two different surgions and is deciding which or them to chrose then
DanielKahneman_2010_0075.wav: the one that cruses in the one that has en ol the memory that is less bad and that's the truth the surgeon that will be chosen
DanielKahneman_2010_0076.wav: the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't chose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future
DanielKahneman_2010_0077.wav: we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories
DanielKahneman_2010_0078.wav: and basictly you can look at the unisa tyrany of the remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010_0079.wav: and you can think of the remembering sof sort of dragging the experiencing self to experiences that experiencing self does'meed
DanielKahneman_2010_0080.wav: i have that sense that when we go on vocations this is very frequently the case that is that it's
DanielKahneman_2010_0081.wav: we we go onvocations to a very large extent in the service of a remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010_0082.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0083.wav: and this is a bit how to druss the fire thig ory na
DanielKahneman_2010_0084.wav: how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanation that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and
DanielKahneman_2010_0085.wav: when i think about that i think about af vecation we had in intoctic o a few years ago which was clearly the bestlication of ete hart and i think of it raterlly often
DanielKahneman_2010_0086.wav: relative to how much i think of other vacations and
DanielKahneman_2010_0087.wav: i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if if i had ever opened the falder with the six hundred pictures in ite i would have spent another hour
DanielKahneman_2010_0088.wav: now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half
DanielKahneman_2010_0089.wav: there seems to be a discrepency ow i may be a bit extreme in o inhow little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more ofverse
DanielKahneman_2010_0090.wav: there is a genuine question
DanielKahneman_2010_0091.wav: why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thort experiment
DanielKahneman_2010_0092.wav: imagining that for your extlication you know that at the end of the tthe vecation all your pictures will be destroyed
DanielKahneman_2010_0093.wav: and you'll get an anisi drug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vocation
DanielKahneman_2010_0094.wav: and and if an if you would choose a different vocation
DanielKahneman_2010_0095.wav: there is a conflict between your two sells and you need to think about how to adudicate that conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time
DanielKahneman_2010_0096.wav: then you get one answer and if you think in terms of of memories you might get another answer
DanielKahneman_2010_0097.wav: why do we bak them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know whither choice between the two sells
DanielKahneman_2010_0098.wav: now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness there e really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one perself
DanielKahneman_2010_0099.wav: and a so you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy of the moments in the experiencing self life
DanielKahneman_2010_0100.wav: and there are happiness for moments as a fairly complicated process what ar the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of
DanielKahneman_2010_0101.wav: getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time
DanielKahneman_2010_0102.wav: da
DanielKahneman_2010_0103.wav: if you ask for the happiness of the rememberingself it's a completely different thing that as not about how happyly a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life
DanielKahneman_2010_0104.wav: very different notions any one who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mesup the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of well being
DanielKahneman_2010_0105.wav: who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years
DanielKahneman_2010_0106.wav: and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization has a world pol with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about
DanielKahneman_2010_0107.wav: their experiences and ther there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells
DanielKahneman_2010_0108.wav: and the main lesson i think that we have learned is ar they are really different
DanielKahneman_2010_0109.wav: you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily thei'r living their life
DanielKahneman_2010_0110.wav: and visversa youn or just to give you sense of the correlation the correlation is about point five with that means as if you met somebody and you were told or his father is six feet tall
DanielKahneman_2010_0111.wav: whow much would you know about this height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody
DanielKahneman_2010_0112.wav: rank their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self
DanielKahneman_2010_0113.wav: so the correlation is low we know something about what control satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important golds are very important we know that happiness is mainly
DanielKahneman_2010_0114.wav: being satisfied with people that we like
DanielKahneman_2010_0115.wav: spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures but thisis dominent so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selvs you are going to end up doing very different things
DanielKahneman_2010_0116.wav: the bottom line of what i've said here is that we really should not think of happiness a as a substutes for well being it is a completely different notion
DanielKahneman_2010_0117.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0118.wav: now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that
DanielKahneman_2010_0119.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0120.wav: we do not attend the sent to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california
DanielKahneman_2010_0121.wav: you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in culifornia if if say you live in ohayo ah and
DanielKahneman_2010_0122.wav: and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places
DanielKahneman_2010_0123.wav: and that contrast says inclimate whell it turns out the climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that besides how happy people are
DanielKahneman_2010_0124.wav: but now because the reflective self is in charge
DanielKahneman_2010_0125.wav: you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to californian the hope of getting happier
DanielKahneman_2010_0126.wav: well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that
DanielKahneman_2010_0127.wav: beha
DanielKahneman_2010_0128.wav: but one thing will happen they will think they are happier
DanielKahneman_2010_0129.wav: because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio
DanielKahneman_2010_0130.wav: and they will feel they made the right decirsion it is very difficult to think straight about well being and
DanielKahneman_2010_0131.wav: i hope i have given you sense of how difficult it is thank you
DanielKahneman_2010_0132.wav: e
DanielKahneman_2010_0133.wav: i give tat i oo ot to di
DanielKahneman_2010_0134.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0135.wav: thank thank you so much now when we are on the fon am few weeks ago am
DanielKahneman_2010_0136.wav: you mentioned to me that a there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallop' serve
DanielKahneman_2010_0137.wav: is that is it somny that you can share since you do have a few moments lefnow
DanielKahneman_2010_0138.wav: short ah i think the most interesting resolv that we found in the gallops of is is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found out with respect to the happiness of the experiencing selfh
DanielKahneman_2010_0139.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0140.wav: when you no we looked at how inhor feelings very withincome
DanielKahneman_2010_0141.wav: and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it's  lod representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year
DanielKahneman_2010_0142.wav: ficfifty thousand
DanielKahneman_2010_0143.wav: sixty fhousand
DanielKahneman_2010_0144.wav: ne
DanielKahneman_2010_0145.wav: sixty thousand eson sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they yet progressively unhappy of the poor er vigiet above that we get an absolute ly flat line i mean i've really seen lyine so flat
DanielKahneman_2010_0146.wav: clearly what havs happened is money does not bu you experientral happiness but lack of money certainly buys your misery
DanielKahneman_2010_0147.wav: and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of this
DanielKahneman_2010_0148.wav: the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you are the more satisfied your that does not hold for emotion
DanielKahneman_2010_0149.wav: but doni vi the unwhole american endeavor is about in a life liberty of the pursuit of happiness
DanielKahneman_2010_0150.wav: 
DanielKahneman_2010_0151.wav: if people took seriously that fineding amit it seems to tun upside down everything we believe about
DanielKahneman_2010_0152.wav: wen i might for example taxation policy and so forth is there is there any chance that politicians that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it
DanielKahneman_2010_0153.wav: ou know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness resutr in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the yuke it is happening and in other countries it is happening
DanielKahneman_2010_0154.wav: people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of public policy
DanielKahneman_2010_0155.wav: is
DanielKahneman_2010_0156.wav: 's going to take a while and it's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happinus or whether they want to study life i valuations o we need to have tha debate fairly soon how to inhance happiness
DanielKahneman_2010_0157.wav: goes very different ways depending and how you think on whether you think of the rememberingself wor you think of the experiencingself this is going to influence policy i think in he is to come in the united states efforts are being made
DanielKahneman_2010_0158.wav: to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decado to part of national statistics
DanielKahneman_2010_0159.wav: while it seems to me that this issue well or at least should be
DanielKahneman_2010_0160.wav: the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next es thank you so much for inventing behaviour economics
DanielKahneman_2010_0161.wav: acte delycon

EricMead_2009P_0000.wav: a
EricMead_2009P_0001.wav: for some time i have been interested in the placibo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is a something vake
EricMead_2009P_0002.wav: is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real an other words chugerpills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies ah the posebo effect just because the person thinks
EricMead_2009P_0003.wav: that what's happening to them is a farmar sutacle or aa some sort of a for pain management for example if they believe it enough there's a measurable effect in the body called the posebo effect something fake becomes something real because of some one's perception of it
EricMead_2009P_0004.wav: ah in order for us to understand each other i want a start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i mus show you how at works this a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least e nineteen fifties ah i learned myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies
EricMead_2009P_0005.wav: i i'll do it for you and then i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explain it caxbe so i heres it happens knife which you could examine my hand whic you could examine
EricMead_2009P_0006.wav: i cani' hold the knife and my fists like this ii'll get my sleeve back and ought to make sure nothing goes upor down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here i
EricMead_2009P_0007.wav: that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i am squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve and the object of this is quite simple
EricMead_2009P_0008.wav: a
EricMead_2009P_0009.wav: ah i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well
EricMead_2009P_0010.wav: 
EricMead_2009P_0011.wav: my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it
EricMead_2009P_0012.wav: and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve th's no trickeryng and you can examine everything cata
EricMead_2009P_0013.wav: e e ana
EricMead_2009P_0014.wav: so this a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this vary even thohs a very simple trick methoologically probably many of you in the room know this trick a what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand
EricMead_2009P_0015.wav: i say im going to grab hold of my risk to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i'm holding on to my rist is because that's actually the secret
EricMead_2009P_0016.wav: of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger id hear my indects fingers juscan ashift from where it is to a position
EricMead_2009P_0017.wav: finding out like this i
EricMead_2009P_0018.wav: nice sward
EricMead_2009P_0019.wav: some one who didn't have a childhood is out theres
EricMead_2009P_0020.wav: oe
EricMead_2009P_0021.wav: soi does like this from here i and as i move around my finger shifs and we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in the way it processis information it doesn't count one to three it groups them but that's not really what this is about right then i open my hand obviously its clinging there not by animal magnetism but by
EricMead_2009P_0022.wav: cicanory my innext finger being there and then when i closed my finger the same thing as i move back
EricMead_2009P_0023.wav: this motion can have covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there's a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors an thaks now
EricMead_2009P_0024.wav: e
EricMead_2009P_0025.wav: what oes that have to do with the proceble effect well

EricMead_2009P_0027.wav: i read a study ah a year or so ago that really blue my mind wide open i'm not a doctor or a research or so this to me was an astonishing thing
EricMead_2009P_0028.wav: turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like a aspran shaped just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the pacebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective
EricMead_2009P_0029.wav: even though neither one of these things has any farme suitable quits their shuger pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill lilila what
EricMead_2009P_0030.wav: e
EricMead_2009P_0031.wav: that really flit me out turns out though that that's not even where it stops if you ar have capsles
EricMead_2009P_0032.wav: the're more effective than tablets in any form a colored capistle that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capstle dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills
EricMead_2009P_0033.wav: i don't remember this totisticnansfu but the point is
EricMead_2009P_0034.wav: a oo
EricMead_2009P_0035.wav: these dosages have somethingto do with it and the form has somethingand if you want the ultermate in a plocebo you' go to the needle
EricMead_2009P_0036.wav: right a surynged with some innert couple sea seas of some innerts something and you inject this into a patient whille this is such a powerful image in their mind that it is so much stronger than the white pill as it really this graff ona well ill show ite f some other time when we have slides the point is
EricMead_2009P_0037.wav: o i
EricMead_2009P_0038.wav: the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capistel is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real a farmer sutical quality it's only your belief that makes it real
EricMead_2009P_0039.wav: in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a pake trick and make it seem real
EricMead_2009P_0040.wav: an i deri tanaa
EricMead_2009P_0041.wav: and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hat pin it's very very sharp
EricMead_2009P_0042.wav: and iam going to just starelize at a tiny bit ca
EricMead_2009P_0043.wav: this is really my flesh this is not damian's special grown flesh that's my skin right there this is not a holly with special effect i am going to pierce my skin and a run this needle through to the other side
EricMead_2009P_0044.wav: if you're queezy if you're if you faint easl i was doing this for some friends in the a hotel room last night andsome people that i didn't know and one woman almost past out so i suggest if you're me if youd get queesy easy that look awave for about the next thirty in fact iu know aunt i'll do the first bad part behind ityou'll get to see you can look away too if you like to
EricMead_2009P_0045.wav: ah so here's what happens right here a the beginning of my flesh ah at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce
EricMead_2009P_0046.wav: i'm sorry maa hi i might freeking you out ok and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this
EricMead_2009P_0047.wav: iwo
EricMead_2009P_0048.wav: now essentially were in the same position we were in with the knife trick
EricMead_2009P_0049.wav: iktor iof maaio   o e aif it i ha for  hafundan
EricMead_2009P_0050.wav: a sort of
EricMead_2009P_0051.wav: but you can't count my fingers right now canyo smeth sell me show em to you that's ane two three for five asma
EricMead_2009P_0052.wav: e ta a
EricMead_2009P_0053.wav: i know what people think when they see this they go well he would certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes
EricMead_2009P_0054.wav: tof
EricMead_2009P_0055.wav: som my give you a little peak
EricMead_2009P_0056.wav: ae
EricMead_2009P_0057.wav: as that look out there petty good
EricMead_2009P_0058.wav: toiaf i tid
EricMead_2009P_0059.wav: yei no
EricMead_2009P_0060.wav: io werteni
EricMead_2009P_0061.wav: and the people in the back ooca i didn't really see ha people in sadleihte room or like starting to move in now me give you a good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a holly woot special effect that's my flesh
EricMead_2009P_0062.wav: and i can twist that around i'm sorry idon' if you're getting qweezy look away don't look at her thing
EricMead_2009P_0063.wav: people in the back ar people on vitio years from now watching a sigowl ye that looks kind of neat and n
EricMead_2009P_0064.wav: some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be seen as a whole there in a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding
EricMead_2009P_0065.wav: i me work up some blood for him
EricMead_2009P_0066.wav: mi i wi o
EricMead_2009P_0067.wav: ss
EricMead_2009P_0068.wav: i toi bougt e a lo a te aaly w aoa ove a   to ai  oo noid i dexee but  a  wa ni forbat omangioni the e fef de feces o  i wedo
EricMead_2009P_0069.wav: normally now i would take the needle out i would clean ofth my arm and i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of
EricMead_2009P_0070.wav: taking something phake and making it into something real i'm jut going to leave it there and walk off the stage
EricMead_2009P_0071.wav: an wether ta o i  cac e
EricMead_2009P_0072.wav: i will be seeing you several times ovr the next few days i hope you're looking forward to that thank you freve
GaryFlake_2010_0000.wav: oo
GaryFlake_2010_0001.wav: if i can leave you with one big idea to day it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information overlowed
GaryFlake_2010_0002.wav: what i'd like you to think about is how we can use information to that pattern's pop and we can see trins that would otherwise be invisible so what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age this
GaryFlake_2010_0003.wav: tool that i'm musing here is a little experiment is called pivet and with pivet what i can do is i can choose to filter on one particular cause of death say accidents and right away i see there's a different pattern that emergeus
GaryFlake_2010_0004.wav: this is because in the midere here people are their most active and overheare ther their most frail we can step back out again and then reorganize the day that by cause of death
GaryFlake_2010_0005.wav: seeing that circulatory diseases and cansers are the usual souspects but not for every one if we go ahead and we fill ter
GaryFlake_2010_0006.wav: by age say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about
GaryFlake_2010_0007.wav: and be driln to that its especially the case from that so you get the idea that viewing information doing gate in this way is a lot like
GaryFlake_2010_0008.wav: swimming and anliving information and vograpic and if we can do this for raw data why not do it for content as well
GaryFlake_2010_0009.wav: so what we have right here is the cover of every single sport illustratit ever produced
GaryFlake_2010_0010.wav: it's all here it's all in the web you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk with piofit you can drill into a deckade you can drill into a particular year you can jump right into a specific issue
GaryFlake_2010_0011.wav: so i'm looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue the spords i'm a land's armstrong fan so i'll go ahead and alcook on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lancs armstrongas been apart of
GaryFlake_2010_0012.wav: aa
GaryFlake_2010_0013.wav: now if i wanted just cind of take a peak at these i might think well what about taking look at all of cichling so i can step back and expand on that and i see gruggla mand now
GaryFlake_2010_0014.wav: and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrow broader bcking and backing out you're not searching you'r not browsing you're doing something that's actually a little biddifferent it's ind between an
GaryFlake_2010_0015.wav: we think it changes the way information can be used so i wonto extrapulate on this idea bit with something that's a little the crazy what we've done heres we've taken every single wiccapetia page and we reduced it down to a little sommrin so the sommery consist of just little synobsis and a i con to indicate the topical airia that it comes from i'm only showing the top five hundred most popular wiccapetia pages right here but even in this limited view
GaryFlake_2010_0016.wav: we can do a lot of thanks right away we get a sense of whatare the topical domans at our most popular in wicopedia i'm gon to go ahead and slecked government
GaryFlake_2010_0017.wav: now having selected government i could now see that the wickapedia catigories that most frequently correspond to that our time magazene people of the year
GaryFlake_2010_0018.wav: so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikapetia page it's only possible to see that endsiht when you step back at look at all of them looking at one of these particular sumres i can then drill into the consept of
GaryFlake_2010_0019.wav: time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them so looking at these feple i can see that the majority come from government
GaryFlake_2010_0020.wav: some have come from natural sciences
GaryFlake_2010_0021.wav: some few are still have come from business
GaryFlake_2010_0022.wav: 
GaryFlake_2010_0023.wav: there's my bos anda
GaryFlake_2010_0024.wav: 
GaryFlake_2010_0025.wav: one is come from music
GaryFlake_2010_0026.wav: 
GaryFlake_2010_0027.wav: and interestingly enough bone was also ted prise winner
GaryFlake_2010_0028.wav: so we can go jump and take a look at all tetprise winters so you see we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web not from page to page but at a higher level of abstraction
GaryFlake_2010_0029.wav: and so i want to show you one nother thing that may catch yo litt e bit by surprise i'm just showing the new yor times wept it here so pivat this application i don't want a t call to browser's really not a browser
GaryFlake_2010_0030.wav: but you can view wed pages with it and we bring that zumable technology to every single wed page like this so i can step back
GaryFlake_2010_0031.wav: pap right back anto a specific section now the reason why this is importance because by virtue of just viewing wet pages in this way i can look it in my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill in to what i've done
GaryFlake_2010_0032.wav: over specific time frames here in fact is the state of all the demo that i just gave and i can sort of replay amd stuff that i was looking at earlier to day
GaryFlake_2010_0033.wav: and if i wan to step back and look at everything i can sliceen dice my history perhaps by my search history
GaryFlake_2010_0034.wav: here i i's doing some nepatistic searching looking for being over here for live laps pivit and from these i can drill in to the wehas and just launch them again it's one meatow for
GaryFlake_2010_0035.wav: repurpose multibal times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the dayadie so
GaryFlake_2010_0036.wav: right now in this world we think about datas being this curse we talk about the curse of information overlowed we talk about
GaryFlake_2010_0037.wav: drowning in dada what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down
GaryFlake_2010_0038.wav: so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next we get use to the havit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hid ant if we can do that then instead
GaryFlake_2010_0039.wav: of being tract and data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge and of we get the knowledge that ther may be these rom ther's wisdom to be found so  that i thank you
GaryFlake_2010_0040.wav: ii oooobeees is i an dots an e s i an dts an doddo do  do d  do dedo
JamesCameron_2010_0000.wav: o
JamesCameron_2010_0001.wav: i grew up on steady died of sides fiction in high school i i took a buf to school an hour each way every day and a i was always absorbed in a book
JamesCameron_2010_0002.wav: side's fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this ah in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had in and o
JamesCameron_2010_0003.wav: you know that curyosity also manifested itself and in them
JamesCameron_2010_0004.wav: the fact that whenever i wasint in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking
JamesCameron_2010_0005.wav: samples aof frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and ringing it back looking at it under the micrescope i was en all i was reille sidesgak but it was all about trying to understand
JamesCameron_2010_0006.wav: understand the world understand the the limits of of possibility and my or love of of ciad's fiction
JamesCameron_2010_0007.wav: i actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late sixdys
JamesCameron_2010_0008.wav: ah you no we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep otions a jakusto was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in all wondrous world that we could never really have
JamesCameron_2010_0009.wav: previously imagined so that seem to resinate with the whole science fiction part of it
JamesCameron_2010_0010.wav: and i was a an artist ah i could draw like a paint and and i i found that because there werean't in ovidio games an this saturation of si gi movisan and all of this imagery in the media landscape
JamesCameron_2010_0011.wav: i had to create these images in my head out you non't we all did as kids having to a read a book and through the author's description put something on on the screan o the moovy screan in our heads and so my
JamesCameron_2010_0012.wav: response to this was to paint to draw alian creatures alian worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in mathclass in o dudling behind the behind the text book and
JamesCameron_2010_0013.wav: that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened that the jacusto
JamesCameron_2010_0014.wav: shows ah nat yeu got me very excited about the fact that there was an alian world right here on earth i might not really go to an alian world ah on a space ship some day ah that that seemed pretty onpretty darn unlikely
JamesCameron_2010_0015.wav: but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth at was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined ah from reading these books
JamesCameron_2010_0016.wav: so ah i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only probm with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean
JamesCameron_2010_0017.wav: but i didn't let that daunt me ah i pestured my father until he finally found a ascuboclass in in a buffaloo new york reght across the border from where we live
JamesCameron_2010_0018.wav: and i acthally got sirdofied ah in a pool at a wyemsie in the dead of winter and buffalo new york and
JamesCameron_2010_0019.wav: i didn't see the ocean ah a real ocean for another two years until we thoug we moved to california and nhou since then innonin the in the intervening
JamesCameron_2010_0020.wav: forty years ah i've i've spent about three thousand hours under water and five hundred hours of that was insubmercibles and i have learned that that
JamesCameron_2010_0021.wav: that that deepochand environment and even the shallow oceans are so a rich and with ta with amazing life
JamesCameron_2010_0022.wav: that really is beyond beyond our imagination on nature's imagination is so
JamesCameron_2010_0023.wav: so boundless compared to our own a meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is
JamesCameron_2010_0024.wav: is on going and and just as strong as it ever was but a i wen i when i chose a creer as an a dult a
JamesCameron_2010_0025.wav: it was fill making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
JamesCameron_2010_0026.wav: this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges too a trade emages and i was as a kid constantly drawin comic books and son so fill making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that
JamesCameron_2010_0027.wav: i chose to tell where since fixion stories terminator alians then the abyss and with the abyss ah i i was putting together my love of under water and diving with film making sop yo
JamesCameron_2010_0028.wav: merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abys which was
JamesCameron_2010_0029.wav: that to solve a specific narrative problem on that felm which was to create this kind of liquid water creature
JamesCameron_2010_0030.wav: ah we actually embraced a computor a generated animation asi gi and
JamesCameron_2010_0031.wav: this a this resulted in the first soft surface character see gi animation that was ever in a in a moving
JamesCameron_2010_0032.wav: and even though shelln tin make any money i barely broke even i should say i witness something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmorized by this apparent magic in o its arthur clark's law that any sufficiently advanced tecnology as indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical
JamesCameron_2010_0033.wav: and so that that gat got me very excited and i thought wow this is this is something it needs to be embraced into the synematic art so with tha terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ialem we created the liquid metal
JamesCameron_2010_0034.wav: dued in that filmen that the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result a with an audience altough we didn make a little more money on that way ah so
JamesCameron_2010_0035.wav: now drawy a line through those those two two dots of ec of experience came to tes this is gon to be a whole new world this is a whole new world of creativity for
JamesCameron_2010_0036.wav: for film artists so i i started a company with stam wenston my good friend stamwinston who is a th the premior make up an encreature designer
JamesCameron_2010_0037.wav: ah at that time and it was calle diginal domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog paths the kind of analogu processes of of opticle printers in so nand we would go right to diginal production and we accualy did that anit gave us a competitive advantage for a while
JamesCameron_2010_0038.wav: but we found ourselves lagging in the in the midnightes in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do
JamesCameron_2010_0039.wav: so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
JamesCameron_2010_0040.wav: of a visual effects of si ge effects beyond with realistic a human inmotive ah characters generated in s g in the main characters of obiansgi and the world would be in sige and a
JamesCameron_2010_0041.wav: now the emvelop pushed back and i was told by ah athe folks at my company that we weren't gon to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movy about a big ship that sinks
JamesCameron_2010_0042.wav: boa
JamesCameron_2010_0043.wav: an you no i went and pitch it to the studio as romio and juliet on a ship at skunto be this epic romance passionate
JamesCameron_2010_0044.wav: the film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real reck of titanic and that's why i made the move
JamesCameron_2010_0045.wav: oyymymymymymymymymymyymyyy
JamesCameron_2010_0046.wav: and that's the true no studio didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we're gon ta dive to the reckwore en a fillment for real will be using it in the opening of the film all be really importatalby a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding and expedition
JamesCameron_2010_0047.wav: e ta aaeu
JamesCameron_2010_0048.wav: sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality whose actal crated a reality where six months later i found myself in a russian submercibul
JamesCameron_2010_0049.wav: two and half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through avuport natamouvi not ach de forreal
JamesCameron_2010_0050.wav: 
JamesCameron_2010_0051.wav: now that that blom y mind and you know i took a lot of preparation we had to build cammers and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this
JamesCameron_2010_0052.wav: dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technacle and a required enormous planning and you get in this capsil you go down to this dark hostile a environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself
JamesCameron_2010_0053.wav: and ye no i've thought well i'mi'm like living in a science fiction movy this is really cool
JamesCameron_2010_0054.wav: and so ii really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean explaration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity t was imagination and it was in experience
JamesCameron_2010_0055.wav: that hollywood couldn't give me cause you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions
JamesCameron_2010_0056.wav: i was seeing creatures at hydrythernal vancs and and sometimes things that i hadhad never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them so i was completely smitten by this
JamesCameron_2010_0057.wav: and had to do more and so i actually made a conacurious decision after the success of titanic i said o canomona park my day job as a holly wood moovin maker an im goin to go  be a full time explorer for a while
JamesCameron_2010_0058.wav: and so you on we started planning these these expeditions and we waned up going to the bismark and and exploring it with tha with a robatic vehicles we went back to the titanic rick we took little bots that we had created thi spooled of fibr optic
JamesCameron_2010_0059.wav: and hathe idea was to go in indo an interior survey of that ship ah which had never been done nobody ever looked inside di rected idn't have the means to do it so we created tecnology to do it
JamesCameron_2010_0060.wav: to you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submerciful and looking out at planks that looked much like this where i knew that the that the band had played
JamesCameron_2010_0061.wav: and i'm flying a little robatic vehicle through the through the corridor of thof the ship you kno when i say o  know i'm i'm i'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle
JamesCameron_2010_0062.wav: i felt like i was physically present inside the shipreck of titanic and it was e the most serenal canadejavou experience i i've ever had because
JamesCameron_2010_0063.wav: i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set fror months when we were making the movy
JamesCameron_2010_0064.wav: and the set was based as an exact replica on the blue prints of the ship so ther was this absoltly remarkable experience at it really
JamesCameron_2010_0065.wav: made me realize that you' tell the tella presents experience that you actually can have these robotic abatars then your consciousness
JamesCameron_2010_0066.wav: is is ininjected into the into the vehicle into this ti other form of existence and was really really quite profound and i may be a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening me o some decades out as a
JamesCameron_2010_0067.wav: as we start to have a sideborg bodies for exploration or for other means and in many sort of a post human futures that that i can imagine as a science fixin pam so having done these these a
JamesCameron_2010_0068.wav: a expeditions ah and and in a really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vence where we had these
JamesCameron_2010_0069.wav: amazing amazing animals the're baty basice alians right here on earth they live in a a environment of kemo synthesis they don't survive
JamesCameron_2010_0070.wav: on sunlight based system the way we do and so you're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree senigrade water plums that you think they can't possibly exist at the same time
JamesCameron_2010_0071.wav: 
JamesCameron_2010_0072.wav: i was getting very interested in space cience as well again an witc's the science fiction influence as a kid
JamesCameron_2010_0073.wav: and i wound up getting involved with ha the space community really involved with tha with nassa sittig on the nassad visry board planning a actual space missions going to russia going through the pre cosmanat biometical proticals and all these sorts of things
JamesCameron_2010_0074.wav: to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three dhee carmaus systems and this was fascinating but what what i wond up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep
JamesCameron_2010_0075.wav: and taking them down so that they had access ast or biologists planetary scientist people who ware interested in these extreme offile invironments
JamesCameron_2010_0076.wav: taking them down to the ventse and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so an so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space sides
JamesCameron_2010_0077.wav: i had completely closed the loop between being the scientfiction fan ino as a kid and doing this stuff for real
JamesCameron_2010_0078.wav: and in  along the way thain this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about
JamesCameron_2010_0079.wav: leadership ow you think directors got be a leader leader of captain the ship all at's hurthing i nerally learn about leadership until
JamesCameron_2010_0080.wav: 
JamesCameron_2010_0081.wav: i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this wat o i get out of it
JamesCameron_2010_0082.wav: we don't make money at these dam shows ou no we barly break even here' no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails some place u no sitting out the beach  made all these films made all these documentary films that you n't for very
JamesCameron_2010_0083.wav: limited audiens o no fame no glory no munny what are you doing you're doing it for the task itself for the challenge
JamesCameron_2010_0084.wav: and the ocean is the most challenging invironment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens
JamesCameron_2010_0085.wav: when a small group of people form a tightly niptim case we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time
JamesCameron_2010_0086.wav: sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realized that the most important thing
JamesCameron_2010_0087.wav: is the respect that you have for them that they have for you that youh've done a task
JamesCameron_2010_0088.wav: that you can't explain to someone else when you come back to tha shore and you say we now we had to do this and the fibroptic in the attenuation and this an that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea
JamesCameron_2010_0089.wav: you can't explain it to people it's that thing that that may be cops have or people in incombat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond ceats a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next movy which was abatar
JamesCameron_2010_0090.wav: i tried to apply that same principale of leadership which is that you respect your team and you are in their respect in return and i itreally changed the dinamic so here i was again with a small team
JamesCameron_2010_0091.wav: and you know in uncharted territory doing abatar coming up with new technology that didn't exist before tremendously exciting ah tremendously challenging and we became a family
JamesCameron_2010_0092.wav: over a four and half year period a completely changed how i do movy so people of comment at on how you now wil you brought back the ochan a organisms and put them on the planita pandoor to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself the changed as a result of that
JamesCameron_2010_0093.wav: so what can we sent the size out of all this you know what's the what or the lessons learn well i thinknumber one is curiosity it's the most powerful thing you owne imagination
JamesCameron_2010_0094.wav: is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the lorals in the world
JamesCameron_2010_0095.wav: 
JamesCameron_2010_0096.wav: and i have young fill mikers
JamesCameron_2010_0097.wav: come up to me and say you nl give me some advice for doing this
JamesCameron_2010_0098.wav: and i say
JamesCameron_2010_0099.wav: don't put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you don't do it to yourself don't bet against yourself and and take risks a anassa hasthis has this a phraise that they like failure is not an optian
JamesCameron_2010_0100.wav: but failure has to be an option in art and an explaration because it's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required inovation
JamesCameron_2010_0101.wav: was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that's the thought i would leave you with is it in whatever you're doing failure
JamesCameron_2010_0102.wav: is an optor but fear is not that you
JamesCameron_2010_0103.wav: tooobeeaes is i an ots a is i n dts a ododd do o  do de do
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0000.wav: oo
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0001.wav: i'm gam dongl i'm a game designer and i'v been making games on thine now for ten years and a my gold for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in on line games
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0002.wav: now i have a plan for this and it intals convincing more people including all of you to spend more time
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0003.wav: playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing on line games some of you might be thinking
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0004.wav: that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future ait's actually the opposite its true
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0005.wav: three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems am in fact
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0006.wav: i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i have calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of gameplay every week
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0007.wav: so that's a probably a bit of accounter into itive idea so i'll just i'll say it again let it sink in an if we want us all problems like hunger poverty climat change global conflict o beacity
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0008.wav: i believe that we need to aspire to play aims all mine for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0009.wav: no i'm serious
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0010.wav: i am here is why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0011.wav: this is a portrait by a phetographer name phil toldano he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so he set up a camer in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0012.wav: gaming emotion now ah if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the new aunts in this photo you probably see the sense of urgin see a little bit of
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0013.wav: fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem am if you are a gamer you will notice a few new aunces here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprise this is a gamer whos on the verge of something called an epic win now an
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0014.wav: mu mi a
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0015.wav: ah you heard of that o ka good sand we have some gavers among it so an epic win is an oultcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea at was even possible until you achieved it ah it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0016.wav: and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epiquint
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0017.wav: this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of some one
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0018.wav: who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in every day life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'mnot good at life face and has actually mee
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0019.wav: making it can you see it yes good i this s ecully mea making tha i'm not good at life face am thisis a piece of grefety in my old neighborhood in birkly california where i did my peach dee on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful althoug that's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to colabrate and to cooperate and when we're in game worlds
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0020.wav: i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves thou most likely to help at a moment's notice thoug most likely to stick woth ta problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again am and in real life
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0021.wav: when we when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynicl
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0022.wav: we never have those feelings on were playing games they just don existing games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a gried toas sudant what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0023.wav: take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaboratave problem soving environment and i started to notice a few things that make
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0024.wav: epic winds so possible and all mine worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of the allmine games especially in world of woarcraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0025.wav: right away but not just any mission is a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0026.wav: but it is on the the verge of what ou're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft there's no sitting around ringing your hands is always something specific
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0027.wav: and important to be done an theyeare also tuns of claborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0028.wav: ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission as not something we have in a real life that easily the sunset at our finger tips aure tons of colaborators and also there's is epic' story this inspiring story of wh were there
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0029.wav: and what we're doing and then we get all this positive fee back you gies have herd of leveling up and plus ones stranth and plus onc's intelligence ol we don't get that kind of constant fee back in real life when i get off the stage i'm no gin to have you know plus one speaking ad plus one
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0030.wav: crazy idea a plus twiny crazy idea ah i don't get that fee back in real life ah now the problem with collaborative anl mine of varments like world of warcrowd
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0031.wav: is that it's so satisfying to be on the virge of an epiguin all the time that we decide to spend all er time in these gameworlds is just better than reality so so far am collectively all the world of work haf geamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth now
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0032.wav: that's not necessarily a bad thin it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0033.wav: our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate o hey so when we talk about how much time fre curnly investing and playing games
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0034.wav: the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution ah which is an extraordinary thing but it's also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games were actually changing
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0035.wav: what we are capable of as human beings were it evolving to be a more collavorative and hearty species this is true i believeist so consider this really interesting startistic
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0036.wav: i was recently published by recetorac carnigi melin university the average young person to day in a country with a strong gamer culture
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0037.wav: will have spent ten thousand hours playing on line games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0038.wav: for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grate to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0039.wav: so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as heu're learning about everything else in school
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0040.wav: an some of you have probably read malcham gladwell's new book outlires so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hours theory of success its based on this great coginof sciences research that if we can master
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0041.wav: ten thousand hours of effort full study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuo sos at it we'll be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world am and so
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0042.wav: now what were looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtueoso gamers so the big question is
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0043.wav: what exactly our gamers getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0044.wav: this is how many people we hnow have in the world who spend at least an hour day playing on line games these are our virtuose of gamers five hundred million people who are extrardinarly good at something
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0045.wav: and in the next decade we'regan to have another billion gamers who are extrerarlly good
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0046.wav: at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consels that are low energy and that work with the wireless fome net works instead of a broad band innernet so that gam is all over the world particularly an india
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0047.wav: china brizille can get on line they expect one billion more gamers in the next decadeso bing us up to one point five billion gamers
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0048.wav: so i've started to think about what these games are making us virtuous as at here the four things i came up with
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0049.wav: the first is urgent optimism can yu think of this is extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle in obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0050.wav: gamers always believe that an epicine is possible andtha is always worth trying and trying now gamers don't sit around
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0051.wav: ca gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they beaten us badly
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0052.wav: the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with some one we trust that they will spend their time with us thathey will play by the same rules value the same gole they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trusts and cooperation am and and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0053.wav: blissful productivity i love it nor teres a reason why the average world of woarcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game they were actually happier working hard then we are
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0054.wav: relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optamized as human beings to do hard meaning ful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if the're given the right work finally epic meaning
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0055.wav: gamors love to be attached to all inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective am so you all know wicky petia
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0056.wav: biggest wicky in the world second biggest wicky in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of worcraft wicky
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0057.wav: five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the inner net than any other topic covered on any other wickyin the world they are building an epic story they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft o caseo these are four super powers that ad up
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0058.wav: to one thing gamers are super impowered hopeful individuals
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0059.wav: these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that's the problem that i am trying to salv
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0060.wav: ah there s an econmis in edward castronova whose work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in awnline worlds
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0061.wav: and he says we're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exidis to virtual wirls and anline game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0062.wav: a oao
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0063.wav: tat like me emma game doeshine ar unexuberant but he says he says
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0064.wav: that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in all mine world than they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better fee back and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0065.wav: for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world now
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0066.wav: i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to starp making the real world warlk more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0067.wav: twenty five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep snuckles right before we had asom game controllers we had sheep snuckles and a these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0068.wav: an if your familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian heroditus you might know this history ah which is the history of who invented games and why
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0069.wav: herodato says that games particular dice games were invented in the kingdom of lidia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0070.wav: that the king of litia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0071.wav: so according to roditis they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0072.wav: on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and the would be so emerced in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and amerce us in such satisfying blissful prodactivity
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0073.wav: they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day theywould play games and on the next day they would eat and according to heroditis
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0074.wav: they passed eighteen years this way surviving through a famine by eating on monday and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how are yusing games to day
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0075.wav: we're using games to escape real world's suffering we're using games to get away from everything that 's broken in the real environment everything that's not satisfying about real life
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0076.wav: and we're getting what we need from games but it doesn't have to end there this is really exciting according to heroditus after eighteen years the famine was in' getting better so the king decided they would play one final thicegame
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0077.wav: they divided the entire kingdom and half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0078.wav: on an epic adventure they would leave lidia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0079.wav: to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive now this sounds a crazy right
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0080.wav: but recently diane evidence has shown that the atruskins who then led to the roman empire actually share the same diane as a ancient lydiants and so
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0081.wav: reacently scientists have suggested that heroditus's crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might hav actually
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0082.wav: saved their culture by playing games escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually saved the entire civilization that way o et we can do that
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0083.wav: we have been playing warcraft since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time shrategy game from the world o wor half series that was sixteen years ago
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0084.wav: they play dyesgames for eighteen years we've been playing workhalf for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0085.wav: they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so that's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of gameplay
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0086.wav: from let's get half of us too agree to spend an hour day playing games until we sov reail world problems now know you are asking
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0087.wav: how are we in th sal ruo problems and games well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0088.wav: we hav this banner in our offices and paloalto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict to the future but we want to to is make the future
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0089.wav: we want to imagine the best case anarrio outcome an then we want it impower people to make that outcome a reality we want to imagine epic winds and then give people the means to achieve the epic win
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0090.wav: i'am just gon to very briefly show you three games that i 've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epiquins in their own futures
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0091.wav: so this is wirled without oil we made this game in two thousand seven this is an awnline game in which you try to survive an oil's shortage
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0092.wav: the oil shordage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil so when you come to the game
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0093.wav: you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news vitios datd o feeds that show you exactly how much oil coss what's not available how food supplies being affected how transportations being affected a if schools are closhed if there's riding and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blocg about it
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0094.wav: to post vidios to post photoes we've piloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand seven and we've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transform itof experience nobody wants to change how they live just because
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0095.wav: it's good for the world or because resposed to but if you immersem in an epic adventure and tell them
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0096.wav: weve run out of oil this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits they learn in the scame
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0097.wav: so for the next whirld saving game we decided to am higher bigger problem than just peak oil ah we did a game called superstoc at the institute for the future
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0098.wav: and the premise was a super computor has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet the suprecomputor was called the global extinction aware anes system of course nwe askd people to come on line almost like a jerry bruckhamer moovy
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0099.wav: ou know jerry buckhime removies you form a dream team you've got the ashrnot the scientist the ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0100.wav: 
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0101.wav: but in our game insad of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody's on the dream team and it's yur job
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0102.wav: to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0103.wav: we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks that came up with five hundred in sainly creadive solutions that you can go on line if you gougl superstuctancy
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0104.wav: so finally the last game were launching at march third this is a game done with the wirl bank institute if you complete the game you will be
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0105.wav: curtified by the worl bank institute as a social enevator class of two thousand ten working with universities all over subsehare in africa and we are inviting them to learn social enevation skills we've got a graffic novel
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0106.wav: we've got leveling up in skills like local incight knowledge networking sustain ability vision and resourcefulness i would like to nbite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing airias who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0107.wav: som gen a wrap up now i when to ask a question what do you think happens next we've got all these amazing gamers we've got these games that arekind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved the real world yet
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0108.wav: well i hope that you will agree with me that gamors are a human resource that we can use
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0109.wav: to do real world work that games are powerful platform for change we have all these amazing super powers blissful productivity the ability to weave a tight social faboric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for ephic meaning i really hope that we can come together
JaneMcGonigal_2010_0110.wav: to play games at matter to survive on this planet for another century and that's my hope that youwill join me in making and playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure

MichaelSpecter_2010_0015.wav: that seems modern medichine aure ability to feed billians of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out
MichaelSpecter_2010_0016.wav: 
MichaelSpecter_2010_0017.wav: seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news
MichaelSpecter_2010_0018.wav: unfortunately that's all the good nens because there some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that
MichaelSpecter_2010_0019.wav: despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world
MichaelSpecter_2010_0020.wav: every day back numbers rising and it's rising eally rapidly and its disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination
MichaelSpecter_2010_0021.wav: to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arrable land rain forests oil gaspthey're going away
MichaelSpecter_2010_0022.wav: and they're going away soon and unless we inevate our way out of this mass we're going away too
MichaelSpecter_2010_0023.wav: so the question is can we do that and i i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food there will feed millions of people without wraping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it
MichaelSpecter_2010_0024.wav: i really do believe that and no it ain't wish for thinking but here is the thing that keeps me up ad night one of the things that keeps me up at night
MichaelSpecter_2010_0025.wav: a ti
MichaelSpecter_2010_0026.wav: we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can to day we're on the verge of amazing amazing avents in many fields
MichaelSpecter_2010_0027.wav: and yet i actually think we'd oght to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on more french
MichaelSpecter_2010_0028.wav: than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefe and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them fruit and listen
MichaelSpecter_2010_0029.wav: every one's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know a yu're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out
MichaelSpecter_2010_0030.wav: about a decate ago i wrote a story about bhat scenes for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effect of public halthe measure in human history
MichaelSpecter_2010_0031.wav: e
MichaelSpecter_2010_0032.wav: i'dnno what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on an am soon after that
MichaelSpecter_2010_0033.wav: 
MichaelSpecter_2010_0034.wav: i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so
MichaelSpecter_2010_0035.wav: i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franken fouids why they thought mooving lawlakiles around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trest passing on nature's ground
MichaelSpecter_2010_0036.wav: but you know i do wat i do i wrote the story i move don i mean on a journalist
MichaelSpecter_2010_0037.wav: we tit we fil we go to dinner it's fun
MichaelSpecter_2010_0038.wav: dii
MichaelSpecter_2010_0039.wav: but these stories bother meand i couldn't figure out why an eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people
MichaelSpecter_2010_0040.wav: they were exactly like the people in this room
MichaelSpecter_2010_0041.wav: and ait just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world
MichaelSpecter_2010_0042.wav: where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quots around it progress
MichaelSpecter_2010_0043.wav: 
MichaelSpecter_2010_0044.wav: o kay there are reasons for that and i think we know with those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there thathere'is no reason we should of you can just say a few names and people wil understand
MichaelSpecter_2010_0045.wav: turnoble bopaul the challenger
MichaelSpecter_2010_0046.wav: vyachs weapons of mass destruction hanging chads
MichaelSpecter_2010_0047.wav: i mean you know you can choose your list
MichaelSpecter_2010_0048.wav: there are questions and problems whath the people we used to believe were always right so be skeptacal
MichaelSpecter_2010_0049.wav: 
MichaelSpecter_2010_0050.wav: ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof
MichaelSpecter_2010_0051.wav: you need to accept the proof and we're not thut good at doing that
MichaelSpecter_2010_0052.wav: and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an apademic of fear like one that i've never seen in hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story
MichaelSpecter_2010_0053.wav: that linked the epodemic of autism to the measles months and rebella vaxinshot
MichaelSpecter_2010_0054.wav: 
MichaelSpecter_2010_0055.wav: very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tongus of staudies should have beendone its an asserious issue
MichaelSpecter_2010_0056.wav: 
MichaelSpecter_2010_0057.wav: the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweeden from canada andit was all the same no correlation no connection none at all
MichaelSpecter_2010_0058.wav: doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe annecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
MichaelSpecter_2010_0059.wav: we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what
MichaelSpecter_2010_0060.wav: the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because heres a fact
MichaelSpecter_2010_0061.wav: the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaxcine rate for musels is going down
MichaelSpecter_2010_0062.wav: that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible
MichaelSpecter_2010_0063.wav: and what kind of what kind of a thing happened thet we could do that now
MichaelSpecter_2010_0064.wav: i understand it i do understand it because vuthe any one have musels here tos one person in this audience ever see some one dye of musls
MichaelSpecter_2010_0065.wav: doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at al but it happened a hundred ad sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lott od death of measls twenty an hour
MichaelSpecter_2010_0066.wav: 
MichaelSpecter_2010_0067.wav: but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jennema carthy
MichaelSpecter_2010_0068.wav: can go around preaching messages of fear and aliteracy from platforms like opra and larry king live
MichaelSpecter_2010_0069.wav: and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but there almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon

MichaelSpecter_2010_0117.wav: you dont want to do that i have to say i don't understand it om we object to gunetically engineered food why do we do that whil the things i constantly here are

MichaelSpecter_2010_0123.wav: it's not even an ideal it's a process
MichaelSpecter_2010_0124.wav: it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesns but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid
MichaelSpecter_2010_0125.wav: is really very deadening ind its preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next
MichaelSpecter_2010_0126.wav: fifty years weregin to have to grow seventy per cent more food than we do right now seventy per cent this is investment in africa over last thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why

RobertGupta_2010U_0001.wav: one day losanjelis times call mis stivlopas was walking along the streets of down town lasanjelus when he heard
RobertGupta_2010U_0002.wav: beautiful music and the source was a man
RobertGupta_2010U_0003.wav: an african american man charming rugged homeless playing a violend that only had two strings
RobertGupta_2010U_0004.wav: i 'm telling a story that many of you know because steev's columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a moovy
RobertGupta_2010U_0005.wav: with robert downiy junior acting a stivholopas and jamie fox says nethanel anthony ars the juliard traine double basis whose promising career was cut short
RobertGupta_2010U_0006.wav: by a tragic affliction with paranide skitzophrenia
RobertGupta_2010U_0007.wav: nethanel dropped out of juliard he suffered a complete break down and thirty years later he was living homeless on the streets of skidro in donton lasantelis i encourage all of you to read steave's book or to watch the movy to understand not only the beautiful bond
RobertGupta_2010U_0008.wav: that form between these two men but how music helpd shaped that bond and ultimately was instrumental if you'll pardon the pund in helping the thaniel get off the streets
RobertGupta_2010U_0009.wav: i meat mister ars in two thousand eight two years ago at waldisny concert hall he had just heard of performance of batoven's first and fourth symphanies and came back stage and introduced himself when speaking in a very joviald and gregarious way about yoyoma and hillery clenton and how the dodgers were never gon to make the world series all because of the treacherous first violent passage work in the last movement of batoven's fourth symphony
RobertGupta_2010U_0010.wav: and we got talking about music and i got an emale from steve a few days later saying that nethanal was interested in a violin lesson with me now i should mention that nethanel refuses treatment
RobertGupta_2010U_0011.wav: because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorozin and handcufs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
RobertGupta_2010U_0012.wav: but as a result now he is prone to these skitzophrenic appesodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding
RobertGupta_2010U_0013.wav: and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skid row exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
RobertGupta_2010U_0014.wav: and nethaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at waltesny concerthal he had a kind of mannic glint in his eyes he was lost
RobertGupta_2010U_0015.wav: and he was talking about invisible deemons and smoke and how some one was poisoning him in his sleep and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraidthat i was ton toluse him that he was going to sink into one of his states
RobertGupta_2010U_0016.wav: and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpegyo is ind other exciting forms of didactic violin petigoti
RobertGupta_2010U_0017.wav: 
RobertGupta_2010U_0018.wav: so i just started playing
RobertGupta_2010U_0019.wav: and i played the first movement of the bato in vylincan churtel and as i played i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nethaniel's eyes
RobertGupta_2010U_0020.wav: it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible farma suiticle a chemical reaction for which my playing the music
RobertGupta_2010U_0021.wav: was its cattlist and the phaniel's manic rage
RobertGupta_2010U_0022.wav: was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity an engrace
RobertGupta_2010U_0023.wav: and in a miracle he lifted his own violen and he started playing by ear certain snippits of violent concertos which he then askd me to complete mendleson chicovski sibelyos
RobertGupta_2010U_0024.wav: an we started talking about music from bath to basoven and broms brook near the all the bees from battok all the way up to esopecasalenan and i understoodthat he not only had an incychlapietic knowledge of music
RobertGupta_2010U_0025.wav: but he related to this music at a personal level he spoke about it with a kind of passion and understanding that i share with my coleigues in the losangulistphilimonic
RobertGupta_2010U_0026.wav: and through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed
RobertGupta_2010U_0027.wav: from the paronoid disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downta masangelis to the charming
RobertGupta_2010U_0028.wav: eir youdyat brilliant juliartraine musician music is medicine
RobertGupta_2010U_0029.wav: music changes us and for nethanial music issanity because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality
RobertGupta_2010U_0030.wav: and that is an escape from his tormented state
RobertGupta_2010U_0031.wav: and i understoo that this was the very escence of art this was the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental cor our emotions
RobertGupta_2010U_0032.wav: and through our artistic lens through our creativity we're able to shape those emotions into reality
RobertGupta_2010U_0033.wav: and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us inspires and unites us
RobertGupta_2010U_0034.wav: and for nethaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
RobertGupta_2010U_0035.wav: the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him
RobertGupta_2010U_0036.wav: and i will always make music with nethaniel whether we ar at waltd isine concerthall or on skidrow because he reminds me why i became a musician thank you

TomWujec_2010U_0001.wav: several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced a designe challenge called the marshmellow challenge and the ideas pretty simple teams of for have to build a tallest freestanding structure out of twenty sticks of spegetty one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmellow the marshmella has to be on top and though it seems really simple it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
TomWujec_2010U_0002.wav: and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorperate it into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then i've
TomWujec_2010U_0003.wav: conducted about seventy designe workshops across the world with students and designers ind architects even the setios of the fortune fifty and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i like to share some of them with you so
TomWujec_2010U_0004.wav: normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figar out what is gonto look like they jocky for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketching they lay out sfigetti ah they'd spend themajority of their time assembling the sticks into evergrowing structures and then
TomWujec_2010U_0005.wav: finally just as they're running out of time some one takes out the marsh mellow and then they ginjerly put it on top and they stand back
TomWujec_2010U_0006.wav: and cut o
TomWujec_2010U_0007.wav: they admire their work but what really happens most of the time is that the dtada turns into an oh because the weight of the marshmellow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so
TomWujec_2010U_0008.wav: there are number of people whod have a lot more o moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
TomWujec_2010U_0009.wav: o aas to the heits of
TomWujec_2010U_0010.wav: they lie that a cheep they i get distracted they've and they produced really lamed structures and of course there is theams that have a lot more tada structures and among the best are recent graduates of kinder garden
TomWujec_2010U_0011.wav: depa
TomWujec_2010U_0012.wav: and
TomWujec_2010U_0013.wav: a
TomWujec_2010U_0014.wav: it's pretty maysing as peter tells us ow not only do do they produce the tallest structures but ththe most interesting structures of them all so the question you won't ask is how come
TomWujec_2010U_0015.wav: why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of hus none of the kids spend any time trying to be s iov spegatty ink
TomWujec_2010U_0016.wav: right they don't tie it spend time jocking for par but ther's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan
TomWujec_2010U_0017.wav: right and then they execute on it andthen what happens as when they put the marshmello on  top they run out of time and what happens it's a crisis
TomWujec_2010U_0018.wav: mado
TomWujec_2010U_0019.wav: found familiar right roke wut kinder gardeners do differently is that they start with the marsh mellow and they build prototype successive protetypes
TomWujec_2010U_0020.wav: always keeping the marthnello and top so they have multipal times ad to to fix inte bild protetypes along the way so hesziners recognized this type of calaboration
TomWujec_2010U_0021.wav: as the essence of the iterative process and with each versin kids get instant fee back about what works and what does n't work
TomWujec_2010U_0022.wav: so the capacity to play in protetype is is really essential but let's look at how different teams perform
TomWujec_2010U_0023.wav: so the average for most people is around twenty inches business school students about to half of that lawyers a lttle better but not much better than that kindergardens better than most adelts who does the very best
TomWujec_2010U_0024.wav: architects and engineers thankfully an
TomWujec_2010U_0025.wav: 
TomWujec_2010U_0026.wav: thirty nine inches of the tallest structure a i've seen and why is it because they understand trangles and self reenforcing geometrical patterns or the key to building self a reenforce o the se stable structures
TomWujec_2010U_0027.wav: so i se ios little bit better than average but here's were gets interesting if you put in a executive admen on the team they get significantly better
TomWujec_2010U_0028.wav: 
TomWujec_2010U_0029.wav: credible yu now
TomWujec_2010U_0030.wav: ou look around you go out that teams gono in e doth tal beforehand and why is that because they have special skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays a close attention to to work
TomWujec_2010U_0031.wav: ah will significantly imimprove the team's performance special ite skilles and facilitation skilles at the combination leads to to strong success
TomWujec_2010U_0032.wav: you have ten teams atipically performed you'l get may by six or so that i've standing structures and ai i tried something interesting i thought let's
TomWujec_2010U_0033.wav: up the anti once so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of soft war to the winning team so what do you think happened tothese designed students what was the result
TomWujec_2010U_0034.wav: here's would happen there r
TomWujec_2010U_0035.wav: not one team had a standing structure not one had a a if anyone had bilt say a a one instructure they doidn takeen om the the prize so isn't an interesting that high stakes a have a strong impact we did the exercise again with the same students what d you think happened then so now the understand the value of prodetyping
TomWujec_2010U_0036.wav: so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produce the tallest structures in the least amount a time so there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
TomWujec_2010U_0037.wav: so you might ask why would any one actually spend time ruenning a marshanello a challenge and the reason is i cto help creat viginal tools and processes to help pa teams build cars and vidio games and visual effects a
TomWujec_2010U_0038.wav: and what the marshmellow challenge dozes that helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly
TomWujec_2010U_0039.wav: every project has its own marshmellow des net that the challenge provides a shered experience a commn language a common stance to build the right protetype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you hare interested may wender go to marshamello challenge dodcommange a blog that you can look at how to build a the marshmellows ar step by stepp instructions on this a there are
TomWujec_2010U_0040.wav: crazy examples from around te world of how people tweak and adjust the system there's world records that are on this as well
TomWujec_2010U_0041.wav: and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport ah it demands that we bring all of our senses to the tast and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have a at hand and sometimes a little protetype of theis experience is all that it takes to turn us from a and o moment to a tadam oment and that can make a big difference thank you very much
